# Introduction to Psychology of Learning

Psychology as an Independent Science
- Ebbinghaus 1885/1962
- Thorndike, 1911

**Psychology of Learning:** focus on how people learn and how they interact with the environments in which they learn

**Learning:** Relatively permanent change in behavior that results from experience ( or regularities in the environment of the organism)
- Learning involves some kind of change in the organism, which is necessary but not sufficient for observing a change in behavior.
- Learning changes the physical structure of the brain 

In order to say the learning has occurred, two conditions must be met:
1. An Observable change in behavior must occur during the lifetime of the organism.
2. The change in behavior must be due to regularities in the environment

**Non-associative learning:** Refers to a decrease in the intensity of a response as the result of the repeated presentation of a stimulus

**Cognitive definitions of learning:** are mechanistic & refer to a specific change in the organism, a change in mental constructs (e.g., knowledge, representations, associations)—that can function as a contiguous cause of changes in behavior.

Key Notes
- The Learning Environment makes a Difference
- Learning is based on association (make connections and draw conclusion based on as sense of what they already know and have experienced)
- Learning Occurs in cultural and Social Contexts
- People Learn in Different ways
- People think about their own learning, and Feelings matter



### History of Psychology of Learning

> John B. Watson. 

- Suggested in his work `Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It` that all behaviors are result of the Learning Process.
- Watson's work include the famous `Little Albert Experiment` In which he conditioned a small child to fear a white rat.
- Behaviorism dominated psychology for much of `early 20th Century`
-  behavioral approaches remain important today, the  latter part of the century was marked by the emergence of  `humanistic psychology`, `biological psychology`, and `cognitive psychology`

**Major Learning Theories**
1. Behaviorism: New behaviors or changes in behavior are acquired through associations between stimuli and responses
2. Cognitivism: Learning Occurs through internal processing of information, where the mind functions like a computer, receiving, processing, and storing information
3. Constructivism: We construct our own knowledge from the world based on individual experiences, with learning being an active, contextualized process.

Psychology of Learning describe the Principle of Learning, motivation strategies, transfer of `learning, memory, retnetion and forgetting`
- Acquire a novel Idea
- Retains and applies the idea, skills and knowledge
- Modify one's behavior

#### State of Learner

Conscious/Unconscious: of a need to learn a specific skill or knowledge
Competent/Incompetent : Relative to a specific skill or Knowledge

|                      | **Unconscious**                        | **Conscious**                               |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Competence**        | You do it without thinking             | You know what you know, but it takes effort |
| **Incompetence**      | You don’t know what you don’t know     | You know that you don’t know                |
Note: The state of `conscious incomptence` bay be valuable at the start of Learning Experience


#### What is Effective Learning

**Effective Learning :** that reflective activity which enables the learner to draw upon previous experience to understand and evaluate the present, so as to shape future action and formulate new knowledge

Learning is:
- an activity of construction,
- handled with (or in the context of) others,
- driven by learner’s agency

Effective learning is- all of these at their best, PLUS the  monitoring and review of whether approaches and strategies are proving effective for the particular goals and context

Outcomes of Effective Learning
1. more connected knowledge
2. wider range of strategies
3. greater complexity of understanding
4. enhanced action appropriate to goals and context
5. increased engagement and self-direction
6.  more reflective approach
7. more positive emotions and affiliation to learning
8. more developed vision of future self as a learner
9. greater facility in learning with others
10. more sense of participation in a knowledge community


Learning About Learning
• reviewing how we learn most effectively
• exploring our thinking and problem-solving
• reviewing beliefs about successes
• exploring approaches to anxiety-provoking tasks
• managing feelings that impede learning
• practicing our approach to difficult tasks, talking
ourselves through them
• examining responses to experiences of failure
• analyzing contributions to group tasks



#### How do students think and learn? (15 Principles)

1. Principle 1- Students’ beliefs or perceptions about intelligence and ability affect their cognitive functioning and learning; 
2. Principle 2- What students already know affects their learning
3. Principle 3- Students’ cognitive development and learning are not limited by general stages of development
4. Principle 4 -Learning is based on context, so generalizing learning to new contexts is not spontaneous but instead needs to be facilitated
5. Principle 5- Acquiring long-term knowledge and skill is largely dependent on practice
6. Principle 6- Clear, explanatory, and timely feedback to students is important for learning
7. Principle 7- Students’ self-regulation assists learning, and self regulatory skills can be enhanced, specifically through direct instruction, modelling , support, and classroom organization and structure
8. Principle 8- Student creativity can be fostered by making it an important outcome of the learning process for students and educators.

What motivates Students?
9. Principle 9- Students tend to enjoy learning and to do better when they are more intrinsically rather than extrinsically motivated to achieve by developing increasing competence, the knowledge and skills
10. Principle 10- Students persist in the face of challenging tasks and process information more deeply when they adopt mastery goals rather than performance goals
11. Principle 11- Setting goals that are short term (proximal), specific, and moderately challenging enhances motivation more than establishing goals that are long term (distal), general, and overly challenging
12. Principle 12- Learning is situated within multiple social contexts
13. Principle 13- Emotional well-being influences educational performance, learning, and development

How to assess Student Progress?
14. Principle 14- Formative and summative assessments are both important and useful but require different approaches and interpretations
15. Principle 15- Students’ skills, knowledge, and abilities are best measured with assessment processes grounded in psychological science with well-defined standards for quality and fairness


### Types Of human Learning

1. **Non-Associative Learning:** simples and most elementary of all, since only one element is necessary for the subject to learn something: `a stimulus`
   - **i) Habituation**: A decrease in response to a stimulus after repeated exposure. Example: Getting used to a noise over time.
   - **ii) Sensitization**: An increased reaction to a stimulus after repeated exposure. Example: Becoming more sensitive to a particular sound.

2. **Associative Learning:** Learning that occurs when you form a connection between two events or stimuli. This includes **classical conditioning** (e.g., Pavlov’s dog) and **operant conditioning** (e.g., rewards and punishments).

3. **Meaningful Learning:** Involves understanding and relating new information to prior knowledge, leading to deeper comprehension.
> American theorist David Ausube , the type of learning in which a student relates the new information to the one he already has, adjusting and reconstructing both information in this process


4. **Cooperative Learning:** It is an interactive Learning and  that Learning through collaboration with others. It involves working in groups to achieve a common goal. 
- Shaped by three crucial elements : formation of heterogeneous groups, Positive interdependence, Individual responsibility
>Promoted by : Joh Dewey, Promoted the importance of building knowledge within the classroom based on interaction and so called peer support


5. **Emotional Learning:** Learning that involves understanding and managing emotions, often part of emotional intelligence education.
- It uses stimuli with great affective load 

6. **Observational Learning:** Learning by watching others and imitating their behavior. Also known as **social learning**.
>Albert Bandura : stated that another way of learning a behavior is by watching another subject doing it.

7. **Learning by Discovery:** Learners actively engage in discovering information themselves rather than being told directly.
> Jerome Bruner promulgated the so-called learning by discovery

9. **Rote Learning:** Learning through memorization without necessarily understanding the underlying meaning.
