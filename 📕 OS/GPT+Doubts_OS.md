## multiprocess , multithreading, multiprogramming Advancements ??

To rank multiprocessing, multithreading, and multiprogramming in terms of technological evolution and their advancements, here's the order:

1. **Multiprogramming**: This is the earliest concept, where multiple programs are loaded into memory and the CPU switches between them to ensure that the CPU is utilized effectively. The idea is to maximize CPU usage by managing multiple programs at once, though each program executes independently of the others.

2. **Multithreading**: This is an advancement over multiprogramming. In multithreading, a single process is divided into multiple threads that can run concurrently. Threads share the same process resources but can execute independently, allowing more efficient use of a CPU by performing multiple tasks within a single application.

3. **Multiprocessing**: This involves using multiple CPUs or cores to execute processes simultaneously. Each process runs independently, and the system can execute multiple processes in parallel. Multiprocessing takes advantage of multiple processors to increase computational power and efficiency.

## multiprocessing, 8 core system can run 8 process simultaneously ??

Yes, that's correct. In a multiprocessing system with 8 cores, you can run up to 8 processes simultaneously, with each core handling one process at a time. This allows the system to perform multiple tasks in parallel, taking full advantage of the available processing power. Each core can execute its own process, which improves overall system performance and responsiveness.

## but pc with quad core use lots of apps at same time ??

Even with a quad-core PC, you can still multitask and run multiple applications simultaneously. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Context Switching**: The operating system can switch between tasks quickly, giving the illusion of simultaneous execution. This is known as context switching, where the CPU rapidly switches between different processes or threads.
    
2. **Threading**: Many modern applications and operating systems use multithreading, allowing a single process to run multiple threads concurrently. Even if your PC has fewer cores, it can handle multiple threads from different applications at once.
    
3. **Efficient Resource Management**: Operating systems manage resources efficiently to handle multitasking. They allocate CPU time to different processes and threads, ensuring that multiple applications can run smoothly.
    
4. **Task Scheduling**: The OS uses task scheduling algorithms to manage how processes are assigned to cores, optimizing performance and ensuring responsiveness.
    

So, even though your PC has only 4 cores, it can still manage and execute multiple applications at the same time effectively through these mechanisms.

## context switching is same as task scheduling ??

- **Task Scheduling**: This refers to the method the operating system uses to determine which process or thread gets to use the CPU and for how long. Task scheduling algorithms manage the order and allocation of CPU time to various processes or threads. Examples of scheduling algorithms include Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, and Shortest Job First.
    
- **Context Switching**: This is the process of saving the state of a currently running process or thread so that it can be resumed later and loading the state of the next process or thread that the CPU will execute. Context switching involves saving and restoring the state of the CPU, including registers, program counters, and other information necessary to resume the process or thread.
