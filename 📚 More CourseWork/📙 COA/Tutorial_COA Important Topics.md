- **Fixed representation** -> has fixed number of bits for integer part and for fractional part.
- ex: `10.` or `10.0`, `.15` or `0.15` decimal point is to the extreme left or right

- **Floating point** -> refers to the fact that a number's radix point (decimal point, or, more commonly in computers, binary point) can "float"; that is, it can be placed anywhere relative to the significant digits of the number.
- ex: `5.5` Fraction point is floating

Floating Point is use to make Value Better Representative
#### Floating Point

`101.1` Binary => `2^2 + 2^0 + 2^(-1)` => `5.5` Decimal

Move binary point by `n` bit right =>  Multiply by`2^(-n)`
Move binary point by `n` bit left => Multiply by `2^n`


**Example** 
`101.1` 
Move floating point by one bit right  
`1011 * 2^(-1)` => `(2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0)` x `2^(-1)` => `101.1`


#### Normalization

**Explicit:** `(-1)^S x 0.M x 2^E` -> Binary point to the immediate left of Most Significant `1` Bit
- Ex : `101.1` =>`(-1)^0` x `.1011` x `2^3` 

**Implicit:** `(-1)^S x 1.M x 2^E` -> Binary point to the immediate right of Most Significant `1` Bit
- Ex : `-101.1` =>`(-1)^1` x `1.011` x `2^2` 

**IEEE 754 format** : Common structure in floating-point representation

`[ S | E | M ]`
- `S`  -> (Sign) -> 0(+), 1(-)   Always 1 bit
- `E` -> (Exponent) -> 2^`E`
- `M` -> (Mantissa) -> significant digits of the number (Represent Precision)


**Ques :**  Let `E` is of 4 bit , `M` is of 5 bit Represent `101.1`  Explicit in IEEE 754 format
**Ans** :  `101.1` -> `(-1)^0` x `.1011` x `2^3`
`E` -> `3` Decimal -> `11` binary -> `0011` (in 4 bit)
`M` -> `1011` binary -> `10110` (in 5 bit)
`[ S | E | M ]` => `[0 | 0011 | 10110 ]`

Note:  
- Without changing value, `0` can be added to the right most of a value after floating point, or left most of value before floating point
- In Mantissa `.10110` : `M[10110]` -> `.101100`: `M[101100]` , `0` bit are added to the right most as we can't add it to left most because in Mantissa format, `.` exist at leftmost

**Ques :**  Let `E` is of 4 bit , `M` is of 5 bit Represent `.0110`  Implicit in IEEE 754 format
**Ans** :  `.0110` -> `(-1)^0` x `1.10` x `2^(-2)`
`M` -> `1011` binary -> `10110` (in 5 bit)

**Negative E by 2's Complement**
 `E` -> `-2` Decimal -> Represent Negative by 2's complement -> 2's complement of (`2`) -> 2's complement of (`10`) -> 2's complement of (`0010`) (in 4 bit) -> `0010` + `1101`(one value less than max) + `1` -> `1110`
`[ S | E | M ]` => `[0 | 1110 | 10110 ]`

or 

**Negative E by Biasing**
`E` -> `-2` Decimal + Excess Code ( 4 bit ) -> `-2` + Excess Code ( `-2^(4-1)` to `2^(4-1)-1`) -> `-2` + Excess code (`-8` to `7`) -> `-2` + `8` (max abs value) -> `6` -> `0110`
`[ S | E | M ]` => `[0 | 0110 | 10110 ]`

#### Biasing

Formula to Get value back if Biasing done in format
=> `(-1)^S` x `0.M` x `2^[E-B]`

**Ques:** Find value of `[0 | 0110 | 10110 ]` if biasing was done on it.
**Ans:** `(-1)^0` x `0.10110` x `2^[6-8]`
