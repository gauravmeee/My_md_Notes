### **Earth's Atmosphere – Layers**

Here are key points from the table:

**5. Exosphere (700+ km)**:
    - Outermost layer
    - Merges with outer space
        
**4. Thermosphere (80–700 km)**:
    - Auroras occur here
    - Space shuttles orbit
    - Temperature increases with altitude
        
**3. Mesosphere (50–80 km)**:
    - Meteors burn up
    - Coldest layer
    - Temperature decreases with altitude
        
**2. Stratosphere (12–50 km)**:
    - Contains ozone layer
    - Jet planes fly here
    - Temperature increases with altitude
        
**1. Troposphere (0–12 km)**:
    - Closest to Earth
    - Weather phenomena occur
    - Densest layer
    - Temperature decreases with altitude

### **Layers of Earth (from surface to center)**

| Layer      | Depth Range (approx) | Notes                       |
| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Crust      | 0–35 km              | Outer layer; thinnest       |
| Mantle     | 35–2900 km           | Semi-solid; convection here |
| Outer Core | 2900–5100 km         | Liquid; causes magnetism    |
| Inner Core | 5100–6378 km         | Solid; mostly iron & nickel |
