| ==Coulomb’s Law==                 | Charles-Augustin de Coulomb  | **Electrostatics** – States that the electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. |
| Gauss’s Law                       | Carl Friedrich Gauss         | **Electrostatics** – The total electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed divided by the permittivity of free space.                                                                 |
| Principle of Superposition        | Multiple (General principle) | **Electrostatics** – The net electric field due to multiple charges is the vector sum of the individual fields produced by each charge.                                                                          |
| ==Ohm’s Law==                     | Georg Simon Ohm              | **Current Electricity** – The current through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across it, provided temperature remains constant.                                                              |
| ==Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)== | Gustav Kirchhoff             | **Current Electricity** – The total current entering a junction is equal to the total current leaving it (conservation of charge).                                                                               |
| ==Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)== | Gustav Kirchhoff             | **Current Electricity** – The algebraic sum of all voltages in a closed loop is zero (conservation of energy).                                                                                                   |
| Joule’s Law of Heating            | James Prescott Joule         | **Current Electricity** – The heat produced in a conductor is proportional to the square of the current, resistance, and time (H = I²Rt).                                                                        |
| Biot–Savart Law                   | Jean-Biot & Félix Savart     | **Magnetism** – Gives the magnetic field produced at a point due to a small current-carrying element.                                                                                                            |
| Ampère’s Circuital Law            | ==André-Marie Ampère==       | **Magnetism** – The line integral of the magnetic field around a closed loop is equal to μ₀ times the total current enclosed by the loop.                                                                        |
| ==Gauss’s Law for Magnetism==     | Carl Friedrich Gauss         | **Magnetism** – The net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero, indicating that magnetic monopoles do not exist.                                                                                       |
