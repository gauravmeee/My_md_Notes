### Bellman-Ford Algorithm vs Dijkstra's Algorithm.

##### **1. Distance Vector Routing Protocols**:
   - **Algorithm Used**: **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
   - **Why?**:
     - Nodes share only distance vectors (not the entire topology).
     - Suitable for distributed, iterative updates over time.
     - Example Protocols: **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**.

##### **2. Link State Routing Protocols**:
   - **Algorithm Used**: **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
   - **Why?**:
     - Each node has complete knowledge of the network topology (link states).
     - Computes the shortest path tree from the source to all destinations.
     - Example Protocols: **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**, **IS-IS**.


| Feature                | Bellman-Ford (Distance Vector)      | Dijkstra (Link State)                        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Information Shared** | Distance vectors (next-hop, cost).  | Complete topology (link states).             |
| **Convergence Speed**  | Slower, due to iterative updates.   | Faster, once link states are known.          |
| **Complexity**         | \(O(V \times E)\)                   | \(O(V^2)\) (or better with priority queues). |
| **Loop Avoidance**     | Prone to loops (count-to-infinity). | Less prone to loops.                         |

##### Why Confusion Happens:
- Both algorithms are used in **shortest path calculations**, but they are applied in different routing protocols.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** is often incorrectly associated with distance-vector protocols because both deal with shortest path routing, but the key distinction lies in the **information exchanged and network model**.
