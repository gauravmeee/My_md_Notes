# Subject-Verb Agreement – Detailed Notes

##### 1. **Basic Rule**

The verb must agree in **number** with the **subject**:
- **Singular Subject** → **Singular Verb**  
    _The cat runs._
- **Plural Subject** → **Plural Verb**  
    _The cats run._
    

##### 2. **How to Identify the Correct Subject**

**a. Ignore Prepositional Phrases**
- A **prepositional phrase** starts with words like **of, in, on, with, for, by** etc.  
- These are **not** the subject of the sentence.
- **Correct Subject** is the noun **before the preposition**
- **Example**:  
	_The performance **of the actors** was excellent._  
	→ Subject = **performance** (singular)  
	→ Verb = **was** (singular)

**b. Ignore Extra Information (Interrupters)**
- Phrases between **commas**, **dashes**, or **parentheses** often give extra info and should not affect the verb.
- **Example**:  
	_The teacher, along with the students, **is** attending the workshop._  
	→ Subject = **teacher** (singular)


**c. Unusual Sentence Structure**
- Sentences starting with **"There"** or **"Here"** have the **subject after the verb**.
- **Example**:  
	_There **are** many reasons._  
	→ Subject = **reasons** (plural)

**d. Collective Nouns**
Words like **team, family, group, class** refer to **a group of people**.
- Usually treated as **singular** in American English
- **Example**:  
	_The team **is** winning._


**e. Abstract or Uncountable Nouns**
Words like **advice, information, happiness, news** are **uncountable** and take a **singular verb**.
**Example**:  
_This advice **is** useful._

##### 3. **Relative Clauses and Verb Agreement**

**a. What is a Relative Clause?**
- A **relative clause** begins with a relative pronoun like:  
- **who, which, that, whom, whose**  
- It **adds information** about a noun.
- **Example**:  
	_The students **who study hard** succeed._  
	→ “who study hard” = relative clause

**b. How to Match Verb in a Relative Clause**
- The **verb in the relative clause** must match the **noun it refers to** (called the **antecedent**).
    
|Relative Pronoun|Refers To|Example|
|---|---|---|
|who|person(s)|The boy **who runs** is fast.|
|which|object or idea|The tools **which help** are new.|
|that|people or objects|The books **that are** missing.|

**Tip**:  
- Always ask:  
	→ **What noun is the relative clause describing?**  
	→ Is it **singular** or **plural**?  
	→ Then choose the correct verb form.


##### 4. **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

|Mistake|Correction|
|---|---|
|Matching verb with **closest noun**, not subject|Always match with **true subject**, not nearby word|
|Confusing plural-looking words (e.g., data)|Use correct form: **data = plural** in formal usage|
|Getting misled by **"of the..."** phrases|Subject is before **"of"**|


##### 5. **Quick Identification Checklist**

- Ask: Who or what is doing the action?  
- Ignore: Prepositions, commas, extra phrases  
- Match: Verb with the actual subject  
- Watch for: Relative clauses – identify the correct noun

# Active / Passive Voice


```
Active Voice => Subject + Verb + Object

Passive Voice => Object +  ( Form of 'be' + V3) + by Subject 
                                 ⬇                ⬇
                        to show tense    action done -> Past Participle (V3)
                                 
```


##### **Active -> Passive**

| **Active Voice Tense**    | **Active Voice**                  | **Passive Voice**                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Simple Present**        | do/does + V1                      | is/am/are + V3                            |
| **Present Continuous**    | is/am/are + V1-ing                | is/am/are + being + V3                    |
| **Present Perfect**       | has/have + V3                     | has/have + been + V3                      |
| **Present Perfect Cont.** | has/have + been + V1-ing          | ✖ has/have + been + being + (V3           |
| --------------            |                                   |                                           |
| **Simple Past**           | did / V2                          | was/were + V3                             |
| **Past Continuous**       | was/were + V1-ing                 | was/were + being + V3                     |
| **Past Perfect**          | had + V3                          | had + been + V3                           |
| **Past Perfect Cont.**    | had + been + V1-ing               | ✖ had + been + being + (V3)               |
| -----------------         |                                   |                                           |
| **Simple Future**         | will/shall + V1                   | will/shall + be + V3                      |
| **Future Continuous**     | will/shall + be + V1-ing          | ✖ will/shall + be + being + (V3)          |
| **Future Perfect**        | will/shall + have + V3            | will/shall + have + been + V3             |
| **Future Perfect Cont.**  | will/shall + have + been + V1-ing | ✖ will/shall + have + been + being + (V3) |

**Tenses Not Used in Passive Voice:**
- **Perfect Continuous Tenses** (e.g., _has been doing_, _had been writing_) and **Future Continuous Tense** (e.g., _will be eating_) are **generally not used in passive voice**.

**Reason:**
- These tenses focus on **ongoing or continuous actions**, not on a **completed action done to an object**.
- Passive voice is used to **emphasize the object receiving the action**, which doesn't fit well with continuous duration emphasis.
    
 **Technical Confusion:**
- Their passive forms require awkward constructions like:
    - **been + being + V3** (e.g., _has been being done_)
    - **be + being + V3** (e.g., _will be being completed_)
- These forms are **grammatically possible** but are **rare**, sound **awkward**, and are **not used in practical or general English**.


##### **Models**

| Active Voice  | Passive Voice      |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Can + (V1)    | Can + be + (V3)    |
| may + (V1)    | may + be + (V3)    |
| must + (V1)   | must + be + (V3)   |
| should + (V1) | should + be + (V3) |
| could + (V1)  | could + be + (V3)  |
| might + (V1)  | might + be + (V3)  |
| would + (V1)  | would + be + (V3)  |
