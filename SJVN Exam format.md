- Be ready to discuss your B.Tech projects, internships, and any technical skills in detail.
- Expect scenario-based technical questions to test problem-solving and applied knowledge.
    

**SJVN & General Knowledge (40%)**
- Study SJVN’s business areas, major projects, Navratna CPSE status, and its role in the power sector.
- Understand Government of India policies related to renewable energy, hydropower, and power sector reforms.
