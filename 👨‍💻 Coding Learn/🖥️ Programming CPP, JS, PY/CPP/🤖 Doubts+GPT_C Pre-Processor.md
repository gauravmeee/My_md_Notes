# Macro 
A **macro** in programming refers to a fragment of code that has been given a name.


It is valid but not recommended to override inbuilt functions due to name collision, and you can't access the default  function  let . `for` within the program
```
#define for(n) for(int i=0; i<n; i++) ✅
```

Preferred to use different name for macro

```
#define for_up(n) for(int i=0; i<n; i++) ✅
#define for_down(n) for(int i=n-1; i>=0; i--) ✅
```
