**C++ Code Output**

```cpp
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; 
cout << arr[5]; 
```
```
output
- Runtime Error : out of bound array access ✅
```

```cpp
Int arr[3];
cout arr[2];
```
```
output
- garbage value ✅
```

```cpp
int x = 10, y = 5;
cout << (x > y ? x : y);
```
```
output
- 10 ✅
- 5 
```

```cpp
int x = 5;
int &ref = x; 
ref++; 
cout << x;
```
```
output
- 6
```

```cpp
int x = 5;
int *Ptr = &x;
cout << Ptr;
```
```
output
- Address of x
```

```cpp
void printDigits(int n) {
    if (n == 0)
        return;
    printDigits(n / 10);
    cout << n % 10;
}
int main() {
    printDigits(123);
    return 0;
}
