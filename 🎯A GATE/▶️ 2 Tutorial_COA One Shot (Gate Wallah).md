# [Computer Organization and Architecture One Shot | Maha Revision | CS & IT | Target GATE 2025](https://youtu.be/N-tuZNkNubk)


**Architecture (CA)** -> Conceptual design & fundamental operational structure
-  CPU Design, Instructions, Addressing Modes, Data Format

**Organisation (CO** -> Deals with physical devices and their instructions with a perspective of improving the performance
- I/O Organisation, Memory Organisation, Performance

CA(Design) + CO(Implementation)

Important Topic First -> Floating Point Representation

### Floating Point Representation

The number is represented in format:
sign | exponent | Mantissa
`[S | E | M ]`

Mantissa is signed normalized (implicit/explicit) fraction number exponent is stored in biased form

S :  `1 bit` : 0 (`+ve`), 1 (`-ve`)
**Biased** :  `E = e + bias`, `e = E - bias`

Implicit : `1.M` -> `1.xxx`
Explicit is not important


**IEEE-754 Floating Point Representation**

**1. Single Precision** (Float in `C`)-> `[S|E|M]` 
- Total 32 bit = `[1|8|23]`, bias = 127
**2. Double Precision** (Double in `C` ) -> `[S|E|M]`
- Total 64 bit = `[1|11|52]`, bias = 1023

E = all `0`'s/`1`'s  -> Special Number

```
S   |   E   |   M         |  Number 
----------------------------------------------
0/1 | 0 < E < 1...1 | any | Implicit Normalized
-----------------------------------------------
E = all 0's/1's  -> Special Number

0/1 | 0...0  | 0...0      | +0/-0
0/1 | 1...1  | 0...0      | +∞/-∞
0/1 | 0...0  | M ≠ 0...0  | Denormalized 
0/1 | 1...1  | M ≠ 0...0  | Not a Number
```

**Normalized** ⭐
Emin = 00...01  Single (1), Double(1)
Emax = 11....10 Single(254), Double(2046)
Value implicit = `(-1)^S` x `1.M` x `2^(E-bias)`
Max Value => S =0, E=1...10, M=1...1
Min Value (+ve) => S =0, E = 0....01, M=0...0

**Denormalized**
Value denormalized = `(-1)^S` x `0.M` x `2^(-126 or -1022)`
Max Value => S=0, E=0...0, M=1...1
Min Value => S=0, E=0...0, M=0...01


#### Components of Computer
**CPU** (CPU + ALU)
**Memory** 
**I/O Devices** 

**Other Components**
- System Buses
- CPU Registers

**System Buses** -> Collection of communication lines between components (3 types)
```
┌─────┐                      ┌─────────────┐
│     │ --- Address Bus ---> |  Memory     │
│ CPU │ <--- Data Bus --->   |    &        │
│     │ <--- Control Bus --->|  IO Device  │
└─────┘                      └─────────────┘
```
- Address Bus is only uni-directional
- Address and Instructions can be transferred through Data Bus as Data example :- in effective addressing, and storing program counter address at Stack

**CPU Registers** -> Small storage inside CPU
- General Purpose GPR (`R1`, `R2` etc)
- Special Purpose

**Special Purpose Registers**
1. Accumulator (AC) ⭐ : Store Result generated by ALU
2. Program Counter (PC) ⭐: Store address of Next Instruction
3. Instruction Register (IR) ⭐: Store Instruction fetched by CPU
4. Stack Pointer (SP) : Store Address of Stack in Memory of Processes
5. Flag Register / Program Status Word (PSW) : Store of Status Result generated by ALU such as (zero/nonzero, sign, carry...)
6. Address Register (AR) / Memory Address Register (MAR). Used to send address to Memory
7. Data Register (DR) / Memory Data Register (MDR) / MBR Used to send or Receive Data from memory

**Types of Architecture** (Based on ALU input):
1. AC-Based Architecture `AC -> [ALU] <- Reg/Memo.`
2. Register Based Architecture `GPR -> [ALU] <- GPR`
3. Register-Memory Based Architecture `GPR -> [ALU] <- GPR/Memo`
4. Complex System Architecture `GPR/Mem -> [ALU] <-GPR/Mem`
5. Stack Based Architecture

**Micro Operations** -> operations executed on values store in registers. 

1. Register Transfer
```
R1 <- R2  or R2 -> R1
```

2. Memory Register
```
Read:-

R1 <- M [address]
R1 <- M [1000]
R1 <- M[R2]

Write:-

M[Address] <- R1
```

**Instructions** -> A group of bits which instructs computer to perform some operation

Instruction -> `[ Opcode | Operand Info.]`

- `Opcode` is Mandatory for any instruction, while `Operand Info` is optional

`[Opcode | Operand info.]`
	↓
    3 bits => 2^3 = 8 distinct instructions support
	

**Types of Instruction**
1. 3-Address Instruction: `[Opcode|addr1|addr2|addr3]`
2. 2-Address Instruction: `[Opcode|addr1|addr2]`
3. 1-Address Instruction: `[Opcode|addr1]`
4. 0-Address Instruction: `[Opcode]`

**Ques:** two-address instructions each with 3 bytes. If address length is 9-bits then maximum and minimum how many instructions the system can support.
**Ans:** `[Opcode | a1 | a2 ]` 
          6       9        9    => 3 byte = 2x8 = 24 bit
max instructions = `2^6` = `64`
min instructions = `1`

**Ques:** sixteen 2-address instructions. address length = 8 bit. what is the length of instruction?

**Ans:** 16 instructions
length of opcode => log(16) = 4
`[ Opcode | a1 | a2 ]`
     4           8     8    => 20 bits instruction length

**Ques:** 64 registers, instruction set of size 12, each instruction has five distinct field (opcode + 2 source registers + 1 destination register identifier, and a 12-bit immediate value ). Each instruction stored in byte-aligned fashion. If a program has 100 instructions, the amount of memory (in bytes) consumed by the program text is?? 

64 registers
instruction = 12 bit

base register mode and pc- relative, inter, intera  segment role are only two used for branching

rest are used for computation type instruction


One control word only able to do one micro operation, and these sequence of microoperation result in instruction


why you need hardwired cu , if you could know the signal sequences to perform instruction, simply store the signals in control memory in CU to perform a instruction


Memory Mapped IO -> Commond Adrress, Data and Control Bus -> Waste of Memory

why address bus need for I/O

Modes of Transfer -> Process of IO to ask to send data -> polling

ISR -> input service routine?


Internal Interrupt IO -> example -> memory doesn't have the required content -> page fault -> Instruction restart

Direct memory access
DMA is a special purpose processor as it can genrate address and control signal

question on DMA

one cell access time -> memory access time

![[Pasted image 20250131191035.png]]
****

Simultaneous Access -> if written cache searching/lookup time is negligible


Hierarchy Access - if written cache hierarchy, memory hierarchy level wise memory, 2 level memory system

dirty bit only required in write back cache write.

missed block is stored in cache

Instruction - opcode is mandatory

Disk Addressing Question, Given Address find sector, Given Sector find Address
