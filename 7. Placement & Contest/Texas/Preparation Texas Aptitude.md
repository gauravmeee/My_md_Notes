## 1. The true discount on a bill due 9 months hence at 16% per annum is Rs. 189. The amount of the bill is:

   To find the amount of the bill (Face Value), we use the formula for True Discount:

   TD = (P * R * T) / 100

   where TD is True Discount, P is the Face Value, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period in years.

   Here, TD = 189, R = 16%, and T = 9/12 = 0.75 years.

   189 = (P * 16 * 0.75) / 100

   Solving for P:

   P = (189 * 100) / (16 * 0.75) = 1575

  **Answer:** Rs. 1575.
