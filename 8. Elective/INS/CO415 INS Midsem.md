### DES
The **Data Encryption Standard (DES)** uses a combination of several cryptographic techniques. Here are the main techniques involved:

1. **Feistel Network**: DES is based on the Feistel cipher structure, which splits the data into two halves and applies encryption rounds to each half alternately.
  
2. **Substitution (S-boxes)**: DES uses 8 substitution boxes (S-boxes) to replace parts of the data with other values, making the output nonlinear and hard to predict.
  
3. **Permutation (P-boxes)**: DES applies permutations to shuffle the bits of the data, enhancing diffusion by spreading out the influence of each bit across the entire block.

4. **Initial and Final Permutations**: The data is permuted once at the start (Initial Permutation or IP) and again at the end (Final Permutation) for better diffusion.

5. **16 Rounds of Encryption**: DES applies 16 rounds of encryption, where substitution and permutation steps are repeated for security.

6. **Key Schedule**: DES uses a 56-bit key, which is expanded to generate 16 subkeys (one for each round of encryption).

7. **XOR (Exclusive OR)**: The data is XORed with the subkey during each round of encryption.

These techniques combine to provide confusion and diffusion, the core principles of strong encryption, ensuring that each bit of the ciphertext depends on many bits of the key and plaintext.

# [Shannon's theory of Confusion and Diffusion | Cryptography and Network Security](https://youtu.be/3NpRhXWWWMQ)

## Shannon's Theory of confusion and Diffusion 

1. The terms confusion and diffusion were introduced by ~ *Claude Shannon*.
2. Shannon's concern was to prevent crypt analysis, based on statistical analysis. The reason is as follows.

	Assume attacker has some knowledge of the statistical characteristics of the plaintext (eg:- in a Msg, the frequency distribution of the various letters may be known.)
	If these statistics are in any way reflected in ciphertext, the cryptanalysis i.e. attacker may be able to deduce the encryption key.

The Shannon's suggested 2 Methods for frustrating the attackers:
**Confusion  & Diffusion :**  Properties for creating a secure Cipher

##### 1. DIFFUSION:
If a symbol in the plaintext is changed, several or all symbols in the ciphertext will also change.
- The Idea of diffusion is to hide the relationship between the `ciphertext` and `plaintext`.

> Wikipedia : Diffusion means that if we change a single bit of the plaintext, then (statically) half of the bits in the ciphertext should change, similarly, if we change 1 bit of ciphertext, then at least one half of the plaintext bits should change.

ex: transpositon

Diffusion implies that each symbol in the 'ciphertext; is depend on source or all the symbols in the 'plain text'
#### 2. CONFUSION:
If a single bit in the key is changed then most/all bits of the ciphertext will also be changed.
- It hides the relationship between ciphertext and key

> Wikipedia : Confusion means that each bit of the ciphertext should depend on several parts of the key, obscuring (make unclear or difficult to understand) the connection between the two.

ex: substitution

In short,
**Diffusion:-** Make statistical relation between `plaintext and ciphertext` as complex as possible.
- if change 1 bit of plain text then half or more bits of cipher should change
- i.e. if we change a single bit of the Plain text then half of the bits in the Cipher text should change and vice versa.

**Confusion:-** Make relation between `key and cipher text` as complex as possible
- each bit of ciphertext should depend on `key`
- changing one bit of the key should change the cipher text completely

##### Substitution Technique
- Letters are replaced by other Letters or symbols
- ex:
```
| a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h | i | j | k | l | m | n | o | p | q | r | s | t | u | v | w | x | y | z |

a -> M
b -> X
x -> Z
g -> A

Plaintext : bag
Ciphertext : XMA
```

##### Transposition Technique
- Applying some sort of permutation on the plaintext letters.
- ex:
```
Plaintext : NESO
Ciphertext: ESON, SONE, ONES or ENOS....
```
# [Caesar Cipher Explained with Solved Example ll Information and Cyber Security Course in Hindi](https://youtu.be/euVke4djgDg)


### Substitution Cypher Technique
Letters are replaced by other letters or symbols.

Caesar Cipher :
- The earlier known and simplest method used by Julius Caesar.
- Replacing each letter of the alphabet with the letter standing three places further down the alphabet.
- Ex: Caesar Cipher (Easiest Method of substitution)

### Caesar Cipher 

*Note:* we will use lowercase alphabets for cipher text, and upper text for plain text, to differentiate between them.
```
Plain Text Alphabets :- A B C D E  F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Cipher Text Alphabets:- d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c

A(a), B(b), ..... Z(z)
 0      1   ...... 25
```

##### Encryption Function: `C = E(3,P)=(P+3)mod26`
- E: Encryption, P: plain text, C: cipher text

Ex: let P='A'
	C = E(3, P) = ( P+3) => ('A' + 3)%26 => (0+3)%26 => (3) = ('D')
	- Significance: Each Character Shifted by 3 
	- It is a kind of mapping function

Example of Message
```
Plain Text: FIVE MINUTES ENGINEERING
Cipher text: ilyh plqxwhv hgjlqhhulgj
```

ㅡ   ㅡ    ㅡ 

Now Check for Each Alphabets in The table, Pair wise.

Rules: 
1. If the pairs lie in same column -> then substitute the alphabets with there immediate down alphabet (last immediate's down will be first)
	eg. JA->SB : j->s, a->b
	
2. If the pairs lie in same row -> then take immediate right (Last immediate right  will be first)
	eg. ZX->UZ: z->u, x->z

3. If the pairs don't lie in same row and column, Make a rectangle ,consider the pair cells as two corner of the rectangle, and find out two other corner. the new corner cell/Alphabet will be substite the previous one with the same row.
	eg. FX-IV> f->i/j, x->v

Feistel Cipher model is a structure or a design used to develop many block ciphers such as DES. Feistel cipher may have invertible, non-invertible and self invertible components in its design. Same encryption as well as decryption algorithm is used. A separate key is used for each round. However same round keys are used for encryption as well as decryption.   
 

## Feistel cipher algorithm

- Create a list of all the Plain Text characters.    
- Convert the Plain Text to Ascii and then 8-bit binary format.    
- Divide the binary Plain Text string into two halves: left half (L1)and right half (R1)   
- Generate a random binary keys (K1 and K2) of length equal to the half the length of the Plain Text for the two rounds.   

Generally there are 16 rounds.
     

First Round of Encryption 
```
1. Generate function f1 using R1 and K1 as follows:
f1= xor(R1, K1)

2. Now the new left half(L2) and right half(R2) after round 1 are as follows:
R2= xor(f1, L1)
L2=R1
```

Second Round of Encryption  
```
1. Generate function f2 using R2 and K2 as follows:  
f2= xor(R2, K2)

2. left half(L3) and right half(R3) after round 2 are as follows:
R3= xor(f2, L2)
L3=R2

3. Concatenation of R3 to L3 is the Cipher Text
- Same algorithm is used for decryption to retrieve the Plain Text from the Cipher Text.
```

**Examples:** 
```
Plain Text is: Hello
Cipher Text:  E1!w(
Retrieved Plain Text is:  b'Hello'

Plain Text is: Geeks
Cipher Text: O;Q
Retrieved Plain Text is:  b'Geeks'
```

#### Fiestel Structure Design Features

- Block Size - Fiestal structure is a block cipher not a stream cypher , where group of bits are given as input
	- let's say if it is 64 bits the the block size is of 64. Input block size? output block size?
	- The DES (Data encryption standard) algorithm uses 64 bits block size and AES (Advance encryption standard) uses 128 bit block size.
	- AES - most popular algorithm that we are using in today's contemporary and secured world. Many Feature of AES are still unbreakable, that's why it widely used.
	- DES - Outdated! no more in use because it can be easily hacked
- Key Size - For n rounds, we need n keys. All round keys are generated from the original What is the original key size? round key size?
	- For greater security we need bigger key size but unfortunately it may decrease the encryption and decryption speed, we need high speed also. more time for encryption and decryption obviously we will not prefer such algorithm/block cypher algorithms. at the same time if the key size is smaller, it will be vulnerable to brute force attack and it le to lesser confusion.
	- From Fiestel cypher we need greater confusion, diffusion and high security
- Number of Rounds - If there is one round, it can be easily broken. How many rounds?? we need to carry out in order to gerater the cypher text.
	- for Encryption there are `16`rounds, and obviously we need `16` for decryption, because it is a symmetric encryption model. (Same key is used for encryption and decryption). The only difference is the order of usage, so the real security relies in the number of rounds. 
- Subkey generation algorithm - we need subkey generation algorithm to generate round keys from original keys. If the key size is great it will be difficult to break, so key should also have greater complexity
- Round Function(F) - We need some complex design in there round function for better confusion and diffusion. that is complex design
- Fast Encryption/Decryption Algorithm - In most of the cases, encryption is actually a part of the application or in hardware. so wee need this to be carried out as fast as it should be be, because ultimately we are going to transfer the data. 
- Ease of Analysis - In crypt analyst perspective, it should not be easy for them to analyze  what is happening in the entire process

- Distributive laws (M3): 
- $a.(b+c)= a.b +a.c$   for all $a, b, c ∈ R$
- $(a+b).c= a.c +b.c$   for all $a, b, c ∈ R$

Note:- 
Associative have only one operation `Multiplication or Addition`
Distributive have both operations `Addition and Multiplication`

*Note:* as we have only `+` and `*` operation, we considered equations `a-b` as :
`a+(-b)` where `a and (-b) ∈ R`.  (`-b` belongs to `R` because it is inverse element of `b` where `b∈R`)

### Commutative Rings

A ring is said to be commutative, if it satisfies the additional condition
- Commutative of Multiplication (M4): $ab=ba$ for all $a, b \in R$

### Integral Domain
An integral domain is a commutative ring that obeys the following axiom.
its mean integral domain is already in commutative ring.

- Multiplicative Identity (M5): There is an element `1∈R` such that `a1 = 1a = a` for all `a∈R
- No zero divisor (M6): If a, b ∈ R and ab=0, then either a=0 or b=0 `



Group - A1-A4
Abelian Group = Group + Commutative (A5)

Ring = Addition(A1-A5) + Closure, Associative, Distributive (M1-M3)
Commutative = Ring + Commutative of Multiplication (M4)
Integral Domain = Commutative Ring + Axioms


### Field
A field F, sometimes denoted by `{F,+,*}` is a set of elements with two binary operations, called addition and multiplication, such that for all a, b, c ∈ F the following axioms are obeyed.

- (A1-M6): F is an integral domain; that is F satisfies axioms A1-A5 and M1-M6.
- (M7) Multiplicative inverse: For each a in F, except 0, there is an element $a^{-1}$ in F such that   $aa^{-1} = (a^{-1})a$

Note: $a/b = a(b^{-1})$

Example of Fields:
- Rational numbers
- Real numbers
- Complex numbers

### Finite Fields

A finite field or Galois field (so-named in honor of Evariste Galois) is a field that contains a finite number of elements. 
- As with any field, a finite field is a set on which the operation of multiplication, addition, subtraction and division are defined and satisfy certain basic rules.
- The most common examples of finite fields are given by the integer `(mod p)` when p is a prime number

Application areas:
- Mathematics and computer science - Number theory, Algebraic geometry, Galois theory, Finite geometry, Cryptography and Coding theory.
