Graph -> Nodes + Edges

### Types

Undirected Graph
```
〇───〇
│    │   v = 5
〇───〇   E = 6
 ╲  ╱ 
  〇 
Undirected + Cyclic Graph
```

Directed Graph 
```
〇───→〇
│     ↑   V = 5
↓     │   E = 6
〇───→〇
 ╲    ╱
  ⬊ ⬋ 
   〇
Directed + Asyclic Graph => DAG
```

```
〇 : Nodes/Vertices
__ : Undirected Edge (⇄)
─→ : Direted edge
```


**Cyclic Graph** - Contain at least single cycle
```
(1) ───
│      Not cyclic ❌
(2)───  

(1)───(2)
│      │   Cyclic ✅
(3)───(4)

(1)───→(2)
│       ↑  
↓       │   Not cyclic ❌
(3)───→(4)

(1)←──→(2)
│       ↑   Cyclic ✅
↓       │  
(3)───→(4)


cyle: start from a node, and can reach to the node through a path
```

**Path** -  Contain a lot of nodes and each of them are reachable
```
(1)----(2)
        |      12345: Path ✅
        |      12321 : Not path ❌
(4)----(3)     135 : Not path ❌
       ╱
    (5)

- Node shouldn't appear twice in path
- Adjacent Nodes should have edge between them
```

### Degree of Graph

```
Undirected Grpah

(1)----(2)   Degrees(Nodes)
|       |    D(3) = 3
|       |    D(4) = 2
(5)----(3)   D(1) = 2
 ╲      ╱    Degree of Graph = 2*6 = 12
    (4)

Degree (for Undirected Graph) - The no. of edges attach to the node

Property : Total Degree of Graph = 2*E 
```

```
Directed Grpah

(1)───→(2)        Indegree(node)
│       ↑         D(3) = 1
↓       │         Outdegree(node)
(5)───→(3)        D(3) = 2
 ╲     ╱
  ⬊  ⬋ 
   (4)

Degree (for Directed Graph):
Indegree - the no. of incoming edges to the node
Outdegree - the no. of outgoing edges to the node
```

### Edge Weight

```
()---3---()----5---()╲ 
|         |         |  ╲6  
|2        |1        |5  ()
|         |         |  ╱7
()---2----()---1---()╱

If Weight not given - Assume all unity

### Undirect Graph

Input Graph
```
(1)------(2)
 |        |  ╲ 
 |        |   (5)
 |        |  ╱
(3)------(4)
```

Input example
```
5   6   
2   1
1   3
2   4
3   4
2   5
4   5
```

Interpretation (Undirected Graph)
```
5   6    n=5 m=6
2   1    edge1 : 2--1
1   3    edge1 : 1--3  
2   4    edge1 : 2--4
3   4    edge1 : 3--4
2   5    edge1 : 2--5
4   5    edge1 : 4--5

- Nodes- No. of Node Constant
- Edges - No. of Edges Variable (if we join more two nodes in same graph no. of edges increase)
```

How to store??
Two ways - Matrix and List

Adjacency Matrix
```
adj[n+1][n+1] (if 0 based indexing then adj[n][n])

Mark the edge = 1
arr[2][1]=1 and arr[1][2]=1
arr[1][3]=1 and arr[3][1]=1
arr[2][4]=1 and arr[4][2]=1
arr[3][4]=1 and arr[4][3]=1
arr[2][5]=1 and arr[5][2]=1
arr[4][5]=1 and arr[5][4]=1

      0   1   2   3   4   5
	+---+---+---+---+---+---+
0	| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
	+---+---+---+---+---+---+
1	| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
	+---+---+---+---+---+---+
2	| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
	+---+---+---+---+---+---+
3	| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
	+---+---+---+---+---+---+
4	| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
	+---+---+---+---+---+---+
5	| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
	+---+---+---+---+---+---+

Space : N x N (Costly)
```

Implementation Adjacency matrix
```cpp
int main(){
	 int n, m;
	 cin>>n>>m;
	//graph here
	int adj[n+1][n+1];
	for(int i=0; i<m; i++){
		int u, v;
		cin>>u>>v;
		adj[u][v] =1;
		adj[v][u] =1; // only for undirected graph
	}
	return 0;
}
```

Adjacency List
```
List for Each Nodes (In c++, list are vector)
Vector<vector<int>> adj[n+1]
adj[0] -> {}
adj[1] -> {2,3}
adj[2] -> {1,4,5}
adj[3] -> {1,4}
adj[4] -> {3,2,5}
adj[5] -> {2,4}

Space Complexit - 2*E  (Each edges is considered twice)
```

Implementation List
```cpp
int main(){
	 int n, m;
	 cin>>n>>m;
	//List here
	vector<vector<int> adj(n+1);
	for(int i=0; i<m; i++){
		int u, v;
		cin>>u>>v;
		adj[u].push_back(v);
		adj[v].push_back(u); // only for undirected graph
	}
	return 0;
}
```

### Directed Graph

For Directed Graph , Implementation is Same,
but keep keep in mind if `(1)--->(2)` than only consider `adj[1][2]` not `adj[2][1]`
```
for matrix only : adj[1][2] =1
for list only : adj[1].push(2)
```

*Note:* We will use Adjacency list in Every Problem  because of better Space complexity

Weighted Graph:
```
(1)--2---(2)
 |        |  ╲6 
 |3       |1  (5)
 |        |  ╱3
(3)---4--(4)

```

```
Adjacency Matrix -  In Place of marking `1`, use the `weight of edge`
    1   2   3   4   5
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 1 |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 | 0 | 6 | 4 | 0 | 3 |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 3 | 0 |
  +---+---+---+---+---+

```

```
Adjacency List - Use pair for to store node .i.e `adj[x].push(node,weight)`

(1)--2---(2)
 |        |  ╲6 
 |3       |1  (5)
 |        |  ╱3
(3)---4--(4)

vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(n + 1);
adj[0] -> {}
adj[1] -> {(2,2), (3,3)}
adj[2] -> {(1,2), (4,1), (5,6)}
adj[3] -> {(1,3),(4,3)}
adj[4] -> {(3,4), (2,1) ,(5,3)}
adj[5] -> {(2,6),(4,3)}
```

# [G-3. Graph Representation in Java | Two Ways to Represent](https://youtu.be/OsNklbh9gYI?list=PLgUwDviBIf0oE3gA41TKO2H5bHpPd7fzn)

For Java So Skipped.

# [G-4. What are Connected Components ?](https://youtu.be/lea-Wl_uWXY?list=PLgUwDviBIf0oE3gA41TKO2H5bHpPd7fzn)

Components of Graph
```
(1)------(2)       (5)          (8)    (10)
|         |        /  \         /
|         |       /    \       /
(3)------(4)    (6)----(7)   (9)

The 4 Can be considered as A Signle Graph ✅ (but not connected)

Because we Can Define it as,
N=10   M=8
 1      2
 1      3
 2      4 
 3      4
 5      6
 .      .
 .      .
  
The Graph have 4 componets
```

Traversal
```
If we Start from Node (1), we could never reach Node (5) to (7)
For any Traversal in Graph we always use a `visited array` Vis[n+1]

        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
Vis = [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
```


⭐ Always use the for loop in any traversal. so that our traversing not end, on disconnected components i.e. when have multiple components.

*Note:* To Handle any Traversal Algorithm/Function to Handle not connected components use the for loop:
```cpp
for(i=0->10)
	if(!vis[i]) // whenever other component's node appear, pass to function.
		traversal(i); // function to traverse all connected components

```
```                     
                        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
traversal(0) -> Vis = [ 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
traversal(5) -> Vis = [ 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0]
traversal(8) -> Vis = [ 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0]
traversal(10) -> Vis = [ 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
```

# [G-5. Breadth-First Search (BFS) | C++ and Java | Traversal Technique in Graphs](https://youtu.be/-tgVpUgsQ5k?list=PLgUwDviBIf0oE3gA41TKO2H5bHpPd7fzn)

BFS -> Breadth First Search
BFS -> Traversal Technique
BFS -> Level wise Traversal


```scss
N = 8
if Starting Node -> (1)

		  (1)         ----> level 0
		/      \
	 (2)       (6)    ----> level 1
	/   \     /   \
 (3)    (4)  (7)  (8) ----> level 2
		  \  /
		   (5)        ----> level 3


Print :   1  2 6   3 4 7 8  5
Level :  _0_ _1_   ___2___  _3_
```

*Note:* In any Level, Order doesn't matter, you can choose any nodes in any order within a level, basically its depend on the order of neighbour nodes in adjacency list for the node, Just make sure, the order of levels should be maintained.
ex:
``` scss
1 62 4538 5 -> ✔️  order of level is maintained, and order within level is ignored
1 4538 62 5 -> X    level 2 is printed befor level 1
```

Same graph if starting node is (6)
```scss
N = 8
if Starting Node -> (6)

						  (1) <- level1
						/      \
		level2 ->    (2)       (6) <- level0
					/   \     /   \
	   level3 -> (3)    (4)  (7)  (8) <- level1
				level3 ⬈  \  / ⬉level1
						   (5)
				            ⬉level2

Print :   6  1 8 7   2 5  4
Level :  _0_ __1__   _2_  _3_
```

*Note :* We can reach to a `Node` in more than one way from starting, and the distance/level may be different, So we always count the way that is shorter to the Node. So we make a `visited array` to prevent traversing it more than one time from different path
```scss

Node 5 : level 3 ✔️
6 -> 7 -> 5

Node 5 : level 4  X (it should be counted in earlier level)
6 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5
```


## BFS Implementation Approach

Let the graph
```scss
                    (1)
                /           \
               (2)          (6)
             /    \       /     \
            (3)   (4)    (7)    (9)
                 /    \
                (5) __ (8) 
```

##### Initial Configuration 
1. In Queue :  Push Starting Node i.e. `1`
2. Visited Array : Mark the Pushed nodes as `1` i.e. `vis[1]=1`
```
Queue :
|   |

visited array (n+1) :
[ 0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 ]  -> marked starting node as '1'

```

##### Loop Till Queue is Not Empty

Queue Empty ✅ -> Terminate -> All Not Visited


### *BFS C++ Code (0-based Indexing)*
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to return Breadth First Traversal of given graph.
    vector<int> bfsOfGraph(int V, vector<int> adj[]) {
        int vis[V] = {0}; 
        vis[0] = 1; 
        queue<int> q;
        // push the initial starting node 
        q.push(0); 
        vector<int> bfs; 
        // iterate till the queue is empty 
        while(!q.empty()) {
           // get the topmost element in the queue 
            int node = q.front(); 
            q.pop(); 
            bfs.push_back(node); 
            // traverse for all its neighbours 
            for(auto it : adj[node]) {
                // if the neighbour has previously not been visited, 
                // store in Q and mark as visited 
                if(!vis[it]) {
                    vis[it] = 1; 
                    q.push(it); 
                }
            }
        }
        return bfs; 
    }
};
```
*Note:* Code for both Directed and Undirected Graph is Same, Because whether it is directed or undirected, one can't go from node B to A, if it already gone through A to B because of visited array

Extra Function (To make adjacent array)
```
void addEdge(vector <int> adj[], int u, int v) {
    adj[u].push_back(v);
    adj[v].push_back(u);
}
```

main Function
```
int main() 
{
    vector <int> adj[6];
    
    addEdge(adj, 0, 1);
    addEdge(adj, 1, 2);
    addEdge(adj, 1, 3);
    addEdge(adj, 0, 4);

    Solution obj;
    vector <int> ans = obj.bfsOfGraph(5, adj);
    printAns(ans);

    return 0;
}
```
*Note :* We used Array of Vector here for Adjacency List

##### <ins>Time  Complexity</ins>  TC:`O(V+2E)`
`while(!q.empty())` -> run for each nodes : `n`
`for(auto it : adj[node])` -> run for all adjacent node  i.e. degree of nodes (But only not visited satisfy if condition)
                        ->  (node1\*degree of node 1) + (node2\*degree of node 2) + . . . .

Total Time complexity = n + total degree -> n:V, total degree:2E = V + 2E


##### <ins>Space Complexity</ins>  SC`:O(3n)`
n -> BFS( ans ) List
n-> Queue
n -> Visited Node List

# [G-11. Detect a Cycle in an Undirected Graph using BFS | C++ | Java](https://youtu.be/BPlrALf1LDU)

Here, In Place of `queue<node>`, we will keep track of the the previous node from which it come i.e. Parent Node. `queue<node, parent>`

For a Node, If it's one or more adjacent node are already visited. There are two cases
1. If the visited Node is its Parent node. than it is obvious it should be visited. 
2. But if the visited node is not parent that's mean, the visited node is traversed From a different Path and so make a cycle.
3. 
Let Consider the graph
```
✅ -> Already visited
(node, parent)

              /
            (7)
``` 

```
(1, -1) -> {2, 3}
            ^  ^ add in queue and mark it as visited

          Level 0

           (1)

``` 

```
(2, 1) -> {1✅, 5}
                 ^ -> add in queue and mark it as visited
                 
(3, 1) -> {1✅, 4, 6}
                 ^  ^ add in queue and mark it as visited

             Level 1
             
              (2)
             / 
           1 
             \

``` 

```
(4, 3) -> {3✅}

(5, 2) -> {2✅, 7}
                 ^ -> add in queue and mark it as visited
                 
(6, 3) -> {3✅, 7✅}
                 ^ -> It is not parent but already visited 
                     So its mean, it is visited already from different path
