In C++, the Standard Template Library (STL) provides containers that can be used to implement linked lists and binary trees, though not as explicit classes named `LinkedList` or `BinaryTree`. Instead, the STL provides more general-purpose containers and data structures:

1. **Linked List**:
   - **`std::list`**: This is a doubly linked list, which allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements from both ends and the middle. It does not provide random access to elements, unlike arrays or vectors.

   ```cpp
   #include <list>

   int main() {
       std::list<int> myList;
       myList.push_back(1);
       myList.push_front(2);
       myList.pop_back();
       myList.pop_front();
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Binary Tree**:
   - **`std::set` and `std::map`**: These are associative containers that use a balanced binary tree (typically a Red-Black Tree) to store elements. `std::set` is used for storing unique elements, while `std::map` stores key-value pairs.

   ```cpp
   #include <set>
   #include <map>

   int main() {
       std::set<int> mySet;
       mySet.insert(1);
       mySet.insert(2);
       
       std::map<int, std::string> myMap;
       myMap[1] = "One";
       myMap[2] = "Two";
       
       return 0;
   }
   ```

For a more customized or specific implementation of linked lists or binary trees, you might need to implement your own data structures or use third-party libraries.

---
In C++, while the Standard Template Library (STL) provides some tree-like structures through containers like `std::set` and `std::map`, it doesn’t provide a wide variety of tree types explicitly. However, you can implement various tree structures yourself or use third-party libraries. Here are some common types of trees that you might work with or implement:

1. **Binary Tree**:
   - A tree where each node has at most two children, typically referred to as the left and right child.

2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
   - A binary tree where for each node, the left child’s value is less than the node’s value, and the right child’s value is greater. This property allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

3. **Balanced Binary Search Trees**:
   - **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of two child subtrees of any node differ by no more than one.
   - **Red-Black Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree with additional properties to ensure that the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and deletions.

4. **Heap**:
   - A binary tree used to implement priority queues. The heap property requires that each node’s value be greater than or equal to the values of its children (for a max heap) or less than or equal to the values of its children (for a min heap).

5. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**:
   - A tree-like data structure used to store associative data structures, such as dictionaries. It is often used for string storage and retrieval.

6. **Segment Tree**:
   - A binary tree used for answering range queries efficiently. It is often used for problems that involve querying sums or minimums over an interval of an array.

7. **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)**:
   - A data structure that provides efficient methods for querying and updating prefix sums in an array.

8. **B-Tree**:
   - A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. It is commonly used in databases and file systems.

9. **B+ Tree**:
   - A variation of the B-tree where all values are stored at the leaf level, and internal nodes only store keys. It is used extensively in database indexing.
