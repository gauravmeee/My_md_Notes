**Fastest Sort : Quick Sort** -> `TC:O(n*logn)`

>**Comparison Sorting**

Quicksort usually has a running time of `n x log(n)`, but is there an algorithm that can sort even faster? In general, this is not possible. Most sorting algorithms are comparison sorts, i.e. they sort a list just by comparing the elements to one another. A comparison sort algorithm cannot beat `n x log(n)` (worst-case) running time, since `n x log(n)` represents the minimum number of comparisons needed to know where to place each element. For more details, you can see these notes (PDF).

>**Alternative Sorting**

Another sorting method, the counting sort, does not require comparison. Instead, you create an integer array whose index range covers the entire range of values in your array to sort. Each time a value occurs in the original array, you increment the counter at that index. At the end, run through your counting array, printing the value of each non-zero valued index that number of times.

**Balanced->** **Insertion** : `O(logn)` **Find** : `O(logn)`✅\
**Unbalanced->** **Insertion** : `O(n)` **Find** : `O(n)` ❌


## Tree Traversal

>**DFS (Depth-First Search)**

**Traversal order:** Preorder, Inorder, Postorder
**Time complexity:** `O(|E| + |V|)`
**Space complexity:** `O(|V|)`
**Use cases:** Finding connected components, topological sorting, and finding strongly connected components.

>**BFS (Breadth-First Search)**

**Traversal order:** Level by level, from left to right.
**Time complexity:** `O(|E| + |V|)`
**Space complexity:** `O(|V|)`
Use cases: Finding shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and network traversal.
