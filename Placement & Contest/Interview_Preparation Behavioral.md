Your resume looks strong and well-structured. For your upcoming behavioral interview, here are some questions you might encounter based on your experiences and skills. I'll provide sample answers to help you prepare:

### **1. Tell me about a time when you faced a challenge in a project and how you overcame it.**

**Sample Answer:**
"In my role ==as a Python Developer== Intern at Carbon Crunch, I was tasked with ==automating data workflows== to improve efficiency. One major challenge was ==integrating Selenium for data extraction== from various websites, which initially led to ==inconsistent results== due to changes in website structures. To overcome this, I collaborated closely with the team to ==refine our approach==, used ==BeautifulSoup for more reliable== web scraping, and implemented ==error-handling mechanisms== to ensure data accuracy. This resulted in a ==70% reduction in manual processing== time and improved ==data accuracy to 90%.=="

### **2. Can you provide an example of a time when you had to work as part of a team to achieve a goal?**

**Sample Answer:**
"During my ==tenure with Team Raftaar== as the Corporate Co-head, we aimed to win the ASME EFX competition. I ==led a team of== over 10 members ==in designing and developing an Embedded== Software Safety Solution. My role involved coordinating tasks, facilitating communication between team members, and overseeing the development of an Arduino-based Accident Alert system. By ensuring clear communication and leveraging each team member's strengths, we successfully created an award-winning vehicle and secured first place in the competition."

- Team Raftaar -> ASME win competition -> Leading 10 member  -> embedded software -> coordination and communication and overseeing development. -> award-winning vehicle

### **3. Describe a situation where you had to learn something new quickly. How did you handle it?**

**Sample Answer:**
"While working on the ==Flask-based web application for OCR text extraction==, I had to quickly get up to ==speed with OpenCV and pytesseract== for image processing. I tackled this by dedicating focused time to ==online tutorials and documentation==. I also ==joined relevant forums== and sought advice from peers who had experience with these libraries. This ==proactive approach== allowed me to effectively integrate these tools into the project, enhancing the OCR accuracy and overall functionality of the application."

### **6. Can you describe a time when you had to make a decision with incomplete information?**

**Sample Answer:**
"While working on the ==Flask-based OCR application==, we faced a situation where we ==needed to choose the best approach for image preprocessing== with limited information on various techniques. I decided to ==implement a combination of commonly used preprocessing methods,== such as grayscale conversion and thresholding, based on available research and best practices. ==I also set up tests to evaluate the impact of each method on OCR accuracy.== This approach allowed us to make an informed decision and significantly improve text extraction results."
### **4. Tell me about a time when you had to manage multiple tasks or projects simultaneously.**

**Sample Answer:**
"During my Pre-final year at university, I was working on multiple projects, Including the Text Extraction OCR Web App , End Semester Exams and my role as an NSS Executive. Balancing these responsibilities required effective time management and prioritization. I used tools like Google Tasks to organize tasks and set deadlines for each project. By breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps and sticking to a structured schedule, I successfully completed all Task on time and maintained a high level of performance in my roles."

### **5. How do you handle feedback and criticism? Can you give an example?**

**Sample Answer:**
"I view feedback and criticism as valuable opportunities for growth. For instance, during my internship at Carbon Crunch, I received feedback on my initial approach to automating data workflows. My mentor suggested refining the data extraction process to handle website changes better. I took this feedback constructively, collaborated with the team to implement improvements, and ended up enhancing the system's efficiency. This experience taught me the importance of being open to feedback and continuously improving my work."

### **7. Why are you interested in this internship at IBM, and how does it align with your career goals?**

**Sample Answer:**
"I am interested in this internship at IBM because it offers a ==unique opportunity to work with Salesforce technologies== and ==gain exposure to a global leader in technology==. The ==role aligns with my career goals of becoming a skilled software engineer== with expertise in cutting-edge technologies. ==IBM's innovative environment== and ==commitment to professional development== make it an ideal place for me to grow and contribute to impactful projects."
