Note: DES and LEA both Lies in "Fistel Network"  in above Diagram

- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**
    - **Found under the "Symmetric" category → Block Cipher → Fistel network**
    - It is listed as **DESL/DESX**, which are lightweight variants of DES.
- **LEA (Lightweight Encryption Algorithm)**
    - **Not explicitly mentioned in the diagram**, but it would fall under **"Symmetric" category → Block Cipher → Fistel network**
    - It is typically considered part of lightweight block ciphers similar to **HIGHT, LBlock, and SIMON/SPECK**.
