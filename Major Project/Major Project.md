### **LEA (Lightweight Encryption Algorithm)**

- **Definition**: LEA is a lightweight block cipher developed by South Korea's National Security Research Institute (NSRI) for fast encryption and decryption on resource-constrained devices like IoT.
- **Block Size**: 128 bits
- **Key Sizes**: 128, 192, or 256 bits
- **Rounds**: 24, 28, or 32 (based on key size)
- **Operations**: Uses simple operations like XOR, addition, and bitwise rotation for efficiency. **ARX** (Addition-Rotation-XOR)

### **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**

- **Definition**: AES is a widely used symmetric encryption standard established by NIST for secure communication.
- **Block Size**: 128 bits
- **Key Sizes**: 128, 192, or 256 bits
- **Rounds**: 10, 12, or 14 (based on key size)
- **Operations**: Uses substitution-permutation (SP) networks involving byte substitution, row shifting, column mixing, and key addition.

### **Why is LEA better for IoT than AES?**

1. **Efficiency**: LEA requires fewer computational resources (CPU cycles) due to simpler operations (XOR, addition, and rotation).
2. **Low Power Consumption**: Less energy-intensive, making it ideal for battery-powered IoT devices.
3. **Smaller Code Size**: LEA requires less memory, reducing the burden on devices with limited storage.
4. **Speed**: LEA is faster on lightweight processors (e.g., ARM Cortex-M) compared to AES, which involves more complex matrix and substitution operations.

**Trade-off**: LEA is more efficient but less studied and potentially less secure against advanced attacks compared to AES.
