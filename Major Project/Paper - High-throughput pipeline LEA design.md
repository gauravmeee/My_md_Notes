---

This paper describes improvements made to a cryptographic algorithm called LEA (Lightweight Encryption Algorithm) to make it faster and more efficient. The changes are primarily in hardware design, not software. Here's a simple explanation of what was done:

## Hardware Changes

The researchers redesigned the hardware implementation of LEA using a technique called "pipelining." Pipelining is like an assembly line for data processing. Instead of one worker (or circuit) doing all the steps, the process is broken into stages, with different parts working on different stages simultaneously.

**Key Improvements**
1. Faster Processing: The new design can encrypt data much faster than previous versions. It achieves speeds of over 7.5 Gbps (gigabits per second) regardless of the key length used.
2. Consistent Performance: Unlike earlier designs, this new version maintains its high speed even when using longer encryption keys.
3. Efficient Use of Space: While the new design uses more physical space on a chip, it processes data much more efficiently for the space it uses.
4. Compatibility: The new design can easily work with other hardware components, using a 32-bit input/output interface.
    

**Impact**
These improvements make LEA much more suitable for use in Internet of Things (IoT) devices and cloud services, where large amounts of data need to be encrypted and decrypted quickly and efficiently.

In simple terms, they've made a faster, more efficient "lock" for digital data, which is especially useful for the growing number of connected devices and cloud services we use every day.

### Pipelined Architecture

- The encryption process is divided into 8 pipeline stages - 1 input stage, 6 encryption stages, and 1 output stage.
- Each stage takes 4 cycles, allowing efficient overlapping of operations.
    

**Performance Gains**
- Achieves a throughput of over 7.5 Gbps regardless of key length.
- 6.45x faster for 128-bit keys, 7.52x faster for 192-bit keys, and 8.6x faster for 256-bit keys compared to previous high-speed LEA implementations.

**Efficient I/O**
- Uses 32-bit input/output interface for better compatibility with external modules, while maintaining high throughput.

**Consistent Performance**
- Maintains constant throughput regardless of key length, unlike previous implementations where performance degraded with longer keys.

**Area Efficiency**
- Despite increased area, the throughput per area is improved:
    - 2x for 128-bit keys
    - 1.82x for 192-bit keys
    - 2.1x for 256-bit keys  
        Compared to existing high-speed LEA implementations.
        
The pipelined design allows for efficient processing of large amounts of data, making it suitable for IoT and cloud service environments requiring high-speed encryption of substantial data volumes.
