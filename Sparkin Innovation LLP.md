Simply explain me what the app will do?? or the requirement are not clear

###### ChatGPT said:

The app is part of a **multi-step form** for setting up a cloud account.

In **Step 2** (the part you need to build):

1. The user will **select cost-saving actions** they want to perform on their cloud resources.
    
2. The selected actions include:
    
    - **Start/Stop** resources (e.g., EC2, RDS).
        
    - **Pause/Resume** resources (e.g., Redshift clusters).
        
    - **Cleanup** resources (e.g., delete EBS volumes or snapshots).
        
3. There is a **JAM Policy section** with some text:
    
    - It is scrollable.
        
    - Includes a **copy icon** to copy the content.
        
4. Navigation:
    
    - Users can go back to the previous step or proceed to the next step using **Back** and **Next** buttons.
        

âœ… Your job is to:

- Build this step with **state management** (to store the selected actions).
    
- Add **styling** and make it responsive.
    
- Deploy the app and submit the code link + live app link.

I not have much knolwedge aboutthese policies, cloud form, cost-saving action. explain in genral term what I need to create

###### ChatGPT said:

No worries! Hereâ€™s a **simple explanation** of what you need to build:

You are creating a **web page** where the user:

1. **Selects multiple actions** by ticking checkboxes.
    
2. These actions are grouped into categories (like starting, pausing, or deleting resources).
    
3. There is a **scrollable text box** (JAM Policy section) with some content and a **copy button** to quickly copy the text.
    
4. The page has **Back** and **Next** buttons for navigation.

### ðŸ’¡ **Think of it like this:**

Imagine you are creating a form where users select **tasks to manage their services**, such as:

- **Starting or stopping services**
    
- **Pausing or resuming services**
    
- **Cleaning up old or unused services**
    

The **JAM Policy section** is just a text box with information that the user might want to copy.

âœ… You donâ€™t need to know cloud policiesâ€”just focus on building a form with:

- **Checkboxes**
    
- **Text box with scroll + copy button**
    
- **Back/Next buttons**
    
- Store the selected actions in **state**.
