### Subject-Verb Agreement – Detailed Notes

##### 1. **Basic Rule**

The verb must agree in **number** with the **subject**:
- **Singular Subject** → **Singular Verb**  
    _The cat runs._
- **Plural Subject** → **Plural Verb**  
    _The cats run._
    

##### 2. **How to Identify the Correct Subject**

**a. Ignore Prepositional Phrases**
- A **prepositional phrase** starts with words like **of, in, on, with, for, by** etc.  
- These are **not** the subject of the sentence.
- **Correct Subject** is the noun **before the preposition**
- **Example**:  
	_The performance **of the actors** was excellent._  
	→ Subject = **performance** (singular)  
	→ Verb = **was** (singular)

**b. Ignore Extra Information (Interrupters)**
- Phrases between **commas**, **dashes**, or **parentheses** often give extra info and should not affect the verb.
- **Example**:  
	_The teacher, along with the students, **is** attending the workshop._  
	→ Subject = **teacher** (singular)


**c. Unusual Sentence Structure**
- Sentences starting with **"There"** or **"Here"** have the **subject after the verb**.
- **Example**:  
	_There **are** many reasons._  
	→ Subject = **reasons** (plural)

**d. Collective Nouns**
Words like **team, family, group, class** refer to **a group of people**.
- Usually treated as **singular** in American English
- **Example**:  
	_The team **is** winning._


**e. Abstract or Uncountable Nouns**
Words like **advice, information, happiness, news** are **uncountable** and take a **singular verb**.
**Example**:  
_This advice **is** useful._

##### 3. **Relative Clauses and Verb Agreement**

**a. What is a Relative Clause?**
- A **relative clause** begins with a relative pronoun like:  
- **who, which, that, whom, whose**  
- It **adds information** about a noun.
- **Example**:  
	_The students **who study hard** succeed._  
	→ “who study hard” = relative clause

**b. How to Match Verb in a Relative Clause**
- The **verb in the relative clause** must match the **noun it refers to** (called the **antecedent**).
    
|Relative Pronoun|Refers To|Example|
|---|---|---|
|who|person(s)|The boy **who runs** is fast.|
|which|object or idea|The tools **which help** are new.|
|that|people or objects|The books **that are** missing.|

**Tip**:  
- Always ask:  
	→ **What noun is the relative clause describing?**  
	→ Is it **singular** or **plural**?  
	→ Then choose the correct verb form.


##### 4. **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

|Mistake|Correction|
|---|---|
|Matching verb with **closest noun**, not subject|Always match with **true subject**, not nearby word|
|Confusing plural-looking words (e.g., data)|Use correct form: **data = plural** in formal usage|
|Getting misled by **"of the..."** phrases|Subject is before **"of"**|


##### 5. **Quick Identification Checklist**

- Ask: Who or what is doing the action?  
- Ignore: Prepositions, commas, extra phrases  
- Match: Verb with the actual subject  
- Watch for: Relative clauses – identify the correct noun

### Sentence Structure & Punctuation Rules


### 1. **Comma before "because" (when needed)**

• Use a **comma before "because"** only to **avoid ambiguity**.  
**Example:**

- She didn’t marry him, because he was rich. (Implies: She had another reason.)
    
- She didn’t marry him because he was poor. (No comma; implies: poverty was the reason.)
    

### 2. **Comma after introductory subordinating clauses**

• If a sentence **starts with a subordinating clause**, use a **comma** after it.  
**Example:**

- Because it was raining, she stayed home.  
    (No comma needed if main clause comes first.)
    
### 3. **"Although" vs. "But"**

• Don’t use **"but"** after **"although"** — it is **redundant**.  
**Incorrect:** Although he is rich, but he is humble.  
**Correct:** Although he is rich, he is humble.

### 4. **"While" meaning contrast vs. time**

• When **"while"** shows **contrast**, use a **comma**.  
**Example:**

- While he likes tea, I prefer coffee. (contrast)
    
- I was reading while he was cooking. (no comma – time)
    

### 5. **"So" vs. "So that"**

• "So" shows result; "so that" shows purpose.  
**Examples:**

- He was ill, so he stayed home. (result)
    
- He studied hard so that he could pass. (purpose)

### 6. **Do not use comma before "that"**

• Never place a **comma before "that"** in a sentence.  
**Incorrect:** He said, that he was tired.  
**Correct:** He said that he was tired.


### 7. **Use comma with "if" clauses (optional rule)**

• When the sentence starts with "if", comma is **recommended** after the clause.  
**Example:**

- If you study hard, you will succeed.
    
### 8. **Punctuation Rules – Use of Comma with Subordinate Clauses**

or more specifically,  
**"Comma before Subordinating Conjunctions (like 'as', 'because', 'since')"**

• When a **subordinate clause** (introduced by _as, because, since_) comes **after** the main clause, a **comma is needed** before it to avoid ambiguity.  
**Example:** She went home, as it was raining. (clearly means "because")  
• This comma helps clarify the meaning of the sentence.  
• Hence, it's important for clear sentence structure.
