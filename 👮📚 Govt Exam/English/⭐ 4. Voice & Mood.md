**Tenses Not Used in Passive Voice:**
- **Perfect Continuous Tenses** (e.g., _has been doing_, _had been writing_) and **Future Continuous Tense** (e.g., _will be eating_) are **generally not used in passive voice**.

**Reason:**
- These tenses focus on **ongoing or continuous actions**, not on a **completed action done to an object**.
- Passive voice is used to **emphasize the object receiving the action**, which doesn't fit well with continuous duration emphasis.
    
 **Technical Confusion:**
- Their passive forms require awkward constructions like:
    - **been + being + V3** (e.g., _has been being done_)
    - **be + being + V3** (e.g., _will be being completed_)
- These forms are **grammatically possible** but are **rare**, sound **awkward**, and are **not used in practical or general English**.


##### **Models**

| Active Voice  | Passive Voice      |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Can + (V1)    | Can + be + (V3)    |
| may + (V1)    | may + be + (V3)    |
| must + (V1)   | must + be + (V3)   |
| should + (V1) | should + be + (V3) |
| could + (V1)  | could + be + (V3)  |
| might + (V1)  | might + be + (V3)  |
| would + (V1)  | would + be + (V3)  |

# Subjunctive


### 1. Definition

The **subjunctive** is a verb form used to express:
- **wishes, demands, requests, suggestions**
- **necessity, importance**
- **hypothetical or unreal situations**
    

### 2. Forms

- **Present Subjunctive** → base verb (no '_-s_', no '_to_') ⭐
    - _He requested that she **go** home._
    - _It is important that he **be** present._
        
- **Past Subjunctive** → only difference is '_were_' instead of '_was_' ⭐
    - _If I **were** you, I would apply._
    - _I wish he **were** here._
        

### 3. Common Uses

**A. After certain verbs** (request, suggest, recommend, insist, demand, propose)
- _They suggested that she **study** harder._
    
**B. After expressions of importance/necessity** (important, necessary, crucial, vital)
- _It is crucial that the report **be completed** by Friday._

**C. Hypotheticals and wishes**
- _If he **were** taller, he could join the team._
- _I wish it **were** easier._
    

### 4. Contrast with Indicative
- Indicative: _She goes home every day._ (real statement)
- Subjunctive: _I suggest that she **go** home now._ (not a fact, but a request)

### 5. Key Rules to Remember

- No _to_ with subjunctive (not _to be_, just _be_).
- Third person doesn’t take _-s_.
- Only _were_ is used for all persons in past subjunctive.
