### **Time Clauses**

**Rule:**   In time clauses (introduced by **when, before, after, until, as soon as, by the time, while, once**), we do **not** normally use _will_ even if the meaning is future.

- Use **Present Simple** for future reference.
- Use **Past Simple** for past reference.
- The **main clause** carries the future or past tense.
    

**1. Future Reference (Use Present Simple in time clause)**

- ✅ I’ll call you when I **arrive**.
- ✅ We’ll leave before it **gets** dark.
- ✅ She’ll text me as soon as she **reaches** home.
- ❌ I’ll call you when I **will arrive**.
    
**Formula:**   `Time Clause` = `Present Simple → Main Clause` = `Future`


**2. Past Reference (Use Past Simple in time clause)**
- ✅ When he **entered** the room, everyone **stood up**.
- ✅ I waited until she **came**.
- ✅ We left after the movie **ended**.
- ❌ When he **was entered**, everyone stood up.
    

**Formula:**   `Time Clause` = `Past Simple → Main Clause` = `Past Simple/Past Perfect`

**3. Common Conjunctions in Time Clauses**
- **When** → I’ll help you when you **need** me.
- **Before** → Finish homework before you **go** out.
- **After** → I’ll rest after I **finish** work.
- **Until / Till** → Stay here until I **come**.
- **As soon as** → Call me as soon as you **reach**.
- **By the time** → By the time he **finishes**, we **will have left**.
- **Once** → Once he **arrives**, we’ll start the meeting.
- **While** → Stay here while I **make** tea.


**Summary:**
- In **time clauses**, don’t use _will_.
- Use **Present Simple** for future, **Past Simple** for past.
- Main clause shows actual tense (future / past perfect, etc.).
