- Originate several major rivers
- Found along India's western and eastern coast

**Hills**
- Elevated landforms, smaller than mountains
- Generally have a rounded summit
- Formed due to erosion or upliftment
- Less rugged than mountain ranges    

**Mountain Ranges**
- Series of connected mountains
- High elevation with sharp, rugged peaks
- Formed due to tectonic collision or folding    
- Often snow-covered and source of glaciers
    
**Deserts**
- Arid land with very low rainfall
- Sandy or rocky terrain
- Sparse vegetation and extreme temperature variation
- Formed due to dry climatic conditions
    
**Plateaus**
- Large flat-topped elevated regions
- Surrounded by steep slopes
- Often volcanic or tectonic in origin
- Rich in minerals and black soil

**Valleys**
- Low land between hills or mountains
- Usually formed by river or glacier erosion
- Fertile and suitable for agriculture    
- U-shaped (glacial) or V-shaped (river-formed)

**Deltas**
- A delta is a low-lying area at the river's mouth where it deposits sediments, forming a fan-shaped area.
- Formed by deposition of sediments as river slows on meeting sea/ocean.
- Arcuate (fan-shaped), Bird-foot, Estuarine.
- Fertile land, good for agriculture (especially rice); dense population.

**Lakes and Salt Tables (Inland Water Bodies)**
- **Freshwater Lakes** – Formed by glacial, tectonic or rainwater collection.    
- **Saltwater Lakes** – Contain high salinity; often inland and endorheic.
- **Artificial Lakes** – Created by dams or reservoirs.
