# Governors General and Viceroy


**Governor-General**
- **Period**: 1773–1858 (East India Company rule)
- **Role**: Head of British administration in India, representing the Company
- **Power**: Executive and some legislative powers; could override other presidencies
- **Example**: **Warren Hastings, Lord Canning**
- **Key Point**: Title changed to **Viceroy** after 1858

**Viceroy**
- **Period**: 1858–1947 (British Crown rule)
- **Role**: Representative of the British monarch in India
- **Power**: Executive, legislative, and ceremonial; acted as King/Queen’s direct representative
- **Example**: **Lord Curzon, Lord Hardinge, Lord Mountbatten**
- **Key Point**: More ceremonial and symbolic authority; highest in hierarchy

**Why was the title of Governor-General of India changed to Viceroy after 1858?**
- **Before 1858**: India was governed by the **East India Company**, so the head was called **Governor-General**. They represented the Company’s interests.
- **After 1857 Revolt**: The British government decided to take direct control of India (via the **Government of India Act 1858**).
- **Result**:
    - India came under the **British Crown**
    - The **Governor-General became Viceroy** to represent the **monarch (Queen Victoria)** directly
    - The title **“Viceroy”** emphasizes **royal authority** rather than Company administration
- **Key Point**: Powers largely remained the same, but the title reflected **sovereign authority** instead of Company rule.

**Simple Rule to Remember**:
- **Governor-General = Company → Administrative Head**
- **Viceroy = Crown → Monarch’s Representative**
