### Different Language Acceptability

##### **1. Languages Accepted by ==Turing Machine== ==(Type 0)**==

These are called ==**Recursively Enumerable (RE)** ==languages.

**Definition:** A **Turing Machine (TM)** accepts **all languages that are computably enumerable**, i.e.,
- There exists a TM that will **accept** any string in the language    
- It **may or may not halt** for strings not in the language
    
**Key Characteristics:**

- Grammar: ==**Unrestricted Grammar**==
- Rules: Productions of the form `α → β`, where `α, β ∈ (V ∪ T)*` and `α ≠ ε`
- Most powerful class of languages
- Includes all **Type 1, 2, 3** languages
- Turing Machines can simulate **any computation**

**Not Accepted:**
==Turing Machines do **not** accept:==
- ==**Non-computable languages**==, i.e., languages for which no TM exists at all
- ==**Undecidable**== languages can't be fully solved (TM might not halt), but they are **still RE**

**Examples of Turing-Acceptable Languages:**

1. `L = { a^n b^n c^n | n ≥ 1 }`
2. `L = { ww | w ∈ {a, b}* }`
3. `L = { palindromes over {a, b} }`
4. `L = { M | M is a valid C++ program that prints "yes" }`
5. `L = { ⟨M, w⟩ | Turing machine M accepts input w }`
6. Any language that requires **multiple stacks or tapes**
7. Any language describing **complex patterns**, e.g., nested loops, programming logic
8. Any language accepted by:
    - **Finite Automata** (Type 3)
    - **Pushdown Automata** (Type 2)
    - **Linear Bounded Automata** (Type 1)
        

**Examples of Not Turing-Acceptable Languages:**
- `L = { ⟨M⟩ | M does not halt on input ⟨M⟩ }` → ==**Diagonalization language** (non-RE)==

**Conclusion:**
- **Turing Machines accept the broadest class of languages**, including **all formal languages you can describe by any algorithm**.


##### **2. Languages Accepted by ==Linear Bounded Automata== (==Type 1 / CSG==)**

These are called **Context-Sensitive Languages (CSLs)**.

**Definition:** A **Context-Sensitive Grammar (CSG)** accepts languages where:

- Production rules are of the form: `αAβ → αγβ`, where `|γ| ≥ 1`
- Length of the string **does not decrease** in any derivation step
- Grammar is **non-contracting** (except `S → ε` if ε is in the language)

**Key Characteristics:**

- Grammar: ==**Context-Sensitive Grammar**==
- Machine: **Linear Bounded Automaton (LBA)**
- Memory: **==Finite tape bounded by input size==**
- More powerful than PDA, but less powerful than TM
- Can handle **multiple dependencies**    
- Includes all **regular** and **context-free** languages

**Not Accepted by CSG:**
- Context-sensitive grammars **cannot accept**:
	- Languages that are **not recursively enumerable**    
	- Languages requiring **unbounded non-linear memory**
	- Languages with **undecidable or non-computable structure**

**Examples of CSG-Acceptable Languages:** ✅
1. `L = { a^n b^n c^n | n ≥ 1 }`
2. `L = { a^n b^m c^n | n, m ≥ 1 }`
3. `L = { a^n b^n a^n | n ≥ 1 }`
4. `L = { ww | w ∈ {a, b}* }`
5. `L = { strings with equal number of a, b, and c in any order }`
6. `L = { an bn cn dm | n, m ≥ 1 }`
7. Any language where **length and symbol position must be preserved**
8. All languages of **Type 2 (CFL)** and **Type 3 (RL)**


**Examples of Not CSG-Acceptable Languages:** ❌
1. `L = { ⟨M⟩ | M does not halt on input ⟨M⟩ }` → **Halting Problem (non-RE)**
2. `L = { w | w is a valid C++ program that prints "yes" }`
3. `L = { M | M is a TM that accepts empty string }`
4. Any language requiring **general Turing-complete logic with unbounded memory**


**Conclusion:**

- **Context-Sensitive Grammars** accept all languages that need **bounded, but context-aware** structure
- They **include** all **regular** and **context-free** languages
- **Cannot simulate Turing Machines**, hence **cannot accept non-RE or undecidable languages**


##### **3. Languages Accepted by Pushdown Automata (Type 2 / CFG)**

These are called **Context-Free Languages (CFLs)**.

**Definition:**  A **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)** accepts languages where:

- Production rules are of the form: `A → α`, where `A ∈ V (non-terminal)`, `α ∈ (V ∪ T)*`
- Only **one non-terminal on LHS**, and **no context** is required
    

**Key Characteristics:**

- Grammar: **Context-Free Grammar**
- Machine: **Pushdown Automaton (PDA)**
- Memory: Uses **1 stack** (can match nested structures)
- All **regular languages** are also context-free
- Can't match **multiple dependencies** like `a^n b^n c^n`

**Not Accepted by CFG:**
- CFGs **do not accept** languages that require:
	- **More than one dependency check**
	- **Equal count matching across more than two symbols**
	- **Copying/mirroring of substrings**
	- **Non-linear memory** (can’t simulate two stacks)

**Examples of CFG-Acceptable Languages:** ✅
1. `L = { a^n b^n | n ≥ 0 }`
2. `L = { 0^n 1^n | n ≥ 0 }`
3. `L = { a^n b^m | n, m ≥ 0 }`
4. `L = { w ∈ {a, b}* | w is a palindrome }` ⭐
5. `L = { (ⁿ)^n | balanced parentheses }` ⭐
6. `L = { w | number of a's = number of b's, and all a's come before b's }`
7. `L = { a^n b^n + c^m | n, m ≥ 0 }`
8. Any language described by **recursive or nested patterns** using a single stack


**Examples of Not CFG-Acceptable Languages:** ❌ 
1. `L = { a^n b^n c^n | n ≥ 1 }` ⭐
2. `L = { ww | w ∈ {a, b}* }` ⭐
3. `L = { a^n b^n a^n | n ≥ 1 }`
4. `L = { ⟨M, w⟩ | Turing machine M accepts input w }`
5. `L = { strings with equal number of a, b, and c in any order }`
6. `L = { a^n b^m c^n | n, m ≥ 0 }`

**Conclusion:**
- **Context-Free Grammars** accept all languages that can be **parsed using a single stack**
- They **include all regular languages** (Type 3)    
- **Cannot handle** multiple parallel dependencies or simulate Turing machines

##### **4. Languages Accepted by Finite Automata (Type 3 / Regular Grammar)**

These are called **Regular Languages (RLs)**.
**Definition:** A **Regular Grammar (RG)** accepts languages where:
- Production rules are of the form:
    - **Right-linear**: `A → aB | a`
    - **Left-linear**: `A → Ba | a`

- No memory or stack is used    
- Grammar is **contracting** (produces shorter or same-length strings)
    

**Key Characteristics:**
- Grammar: **Regular Grammar (Left or Right Linear)**
- Machine: **Finite Automaton (FA / DFA / NFA)**
- Memory: **No memory (finite states only)**
- **Least powerful** in Chomsky hierarchy
- Cannot count or track nested structures
- Suitable for **simple pattern-based languages**

**Not Accepted by RG:** 
- Regular grammars **cannot accept**:
    - Languages that need **counting/matching**
    - **Nested** or **recursive** structures        
    - Languages requiring **memory or stack**

**Examples of RG-Acceptable Languages:** ✅
1. `L = { a^n | n ≥ 0 }`
2. `L = { a^n b^m | n, m ≥ 0 }`
3. `L = { strings ending with 'ab' }`
4. `L = { strings with no two consecutive b's }`
5. `L = { w ∈ {0,1}* | w contains even number of 0s }`
6. `L = { a^n b^n | n = 0 or 1 }`
7. `L = { w | w does not contain substring 'aa' }`
8. `L = { binary strings divisible by 3 }`
9. Any language defined by a **regular expression**

        
**Examples of RG-Acceptable Languages:** ❌
1. `L = { a^n b^n | n ≥ 1 }` → needs counting 
2. `L = { ww | w ∈ {a, b}* }` → needs memory
3. `L = { a^n b^n c^n | n ≥ 1 }` → not regular
4. `L = { w | w is a palindrome }`
5. `L = { a^p | p is prime }` → non-regular
6. `L = { w | number of a's = number of b's }`
        
**Conclusion:**
- **Regular Grammars** accept languages with **simple linear structure**
- They are the **fastest and simplest** to evaluate
- They **cannot** handle counting, nesting, or memory-based constraints
- **Subset of CFLs and CSLs**
