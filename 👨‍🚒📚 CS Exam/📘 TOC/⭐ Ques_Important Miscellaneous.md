# True / False

### **Ques.** For every **Non-Deterministic Turing Machine (NTM)**, there exists an **equivalent Deterministic Turing Machine (DTM)**. -> True ✅

**Meaning of Equivalent** : Equivalent ⇒ both machines **recognize the same language** (and decide it, if the NTM is a decider).

**Key Idea**

* NTM may have **multiple possible moves** from a configuration
* DTM has **exactly one move**
* DTM simulates **all possible computation branches** of the NTM **systematically**

**How DTM Simulates NTM**

* View NTM computation as a **computation tree**
* Each path = one possible sequence of choices
* DTM performs **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** on this tree
* \==BFS is crucial to avoid getting stuck in an infinite branch==

**Simulation Steps**

* Start from initial configuration
* Enumerate all possible transitions
* Simulate 1 step of every branch
* Then 2 steps of every branch, and so on
* If **any branch accepts**, DTM accepts

**Why BFS, not DFS**

* \==DFS may follow an infinite non-accepting branch==
* BFS guarantees that if an accepting branch exists, it is eventually found

**Case 1: NTM is a Recognizer**

* If input ∈ L → at least one branch accepts → DTM eventually finds it
* If input ∉ L → no branch accepts → DTM may run forever
* Hence, DTM is also a **recognizer**

**Case 2: NTM is a Decider**

* All branches halt
* Computation tree is **finite**
* DTM explores entire tree and halts
* Hence, DTM is also a **decider**

**Conclusion**

* NTM and DTM have **same computational power**
* Nondeterminism does **not** increase language recognition power
* Difference is only in **time complexity**, not computability

**One-line exam answer**

> Every nondeterministic Turing machine can be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine by systematically exploring all computation branches using breadth-first search, hence recognizing the same language.

### **Ques.** Regular languages are closed under infinite union\*\* -> ❌ **FALSE**

**Counterexample**

* Define: `Lₙ = {0ⁿ}` → regular (finite language)
* Consider:- `L = ⋃ₙ ≥ 1 Lₙ = {0ⁿ | n ≥ 1}`
* Now modify:
  * `Lₙ = {0ᵖ | p is prime and p ≤ n}` → regular (finite)
  * `⋃ₙ Lₙ = {0ᵖ | p is prime}` → **not regular**

Thus, infinite union of regular languages **need not be regular**.
