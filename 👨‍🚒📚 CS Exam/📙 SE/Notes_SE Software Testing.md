# Software Testing Notes


### Introduction

- **Software Testing**: The process of ==executing a program== with the ==intent of finding errors==.
- Ensures software meets requirements, is defect-free, reliable, and fit for use.
- Conducted at different levels of SDLC.

### Objectives of Testing

- ==Detect defects== before delivery.
- Ensure requirements are met.
- ==Increase reliability and quality.==
- Validate functionality, performance, and security.
- Reduce maintenance cost.
- Build user confidence.

## Principles of Testing

1. Testing shows presence of defects, not absence.
2. ==Exhaustive testing is impossible==.
3. Testing should start early (shift-left).
4. Defects cluster in few modules.
5. Pesticide paradox: repeated tests lose effectiveness.
6. ==Testing is context dependent.==
7. ==Absence of errors fallacy: bug-free but useless software still fails.==

### Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

1. **Requirement Analysis** – Identify testable requirements.
2. **Test Planning** – Define scope, objectives, resources, risks.
3. **Test Case Development** – Write test cases, test scripts, test data.
4. **Environment Setup** – Hardware, software, network readiness.
5. **Test Execution** – Run test cases, log defects.
6. **Test Closure** – Deliver reports, metrics, lessons learned.
    
### Levels of Testing

1. **Unit Testing**    
    - ==Tests individual components (functions, classes).==
    - Usually automated.
    - Done by developers.
        
2. **Integration Testing**
    - ==Tests interaction between integrated modules.==
    - Approaches:
        - Big-Bang Integration
        - Top-Down
        - Bottom-Up
        - Sandwich/Hybrid
            
3. **System Testing**
    - ==Tests complete system as a whole.==
    - Validates functional + non-functional requirements.
        
4. **Acceptance Testing**
    - ==Done by client/user.==
    - Confirms system meets business needs.
    - Types:
        - ==Alpha Testing== (internal users).
        - ==Beta Testing== (external users).

### Types of Testing

**Functional Testing**
- Validates software functions as per requirements.
- Examples: Unit testing, integration, system, UAT, regression, smoke, sanity.
    
**Non-Functional Testing**
- Checks performance, scalability, security, usability, reliability.
- Examples: Load testing, stress testing, volume testing, compatibility, recovery testing.
    
**Maintenance Testing**
- After deployment, when software is modified.
- Regression Testing – ensures old functionality works after changes.
- Re-testing – validates fixes of specific defects.

### Testing Approaches

1. **White Box Testing** ==(Structural)==
    - ==Internal logic tested.==
    - Techniques:
        - Statement Coverage
        - Branch Coverage
        - Path Coverage
        - Loop Testing
            
2. **Black Box Testing** ==(Functional)==
    - Ignores internal code, ==focuses on inputs/outputs.==
    - Techniques:
        - Equivalence Partitioning
        - ==Boundary Value Analysis==
        - ==Decision Table Testing==
        - State Transition Testing
            
3. **Grey Box Testing**
    - Combines white + black box.
    - Tester has partial knowledge of system.

### Test Documentation

- **Test Plan** – strategy, objectives, resources.
- **Test Case Specification** – input, expected output, actual output.
- **Test Data** – sample inputs for testing.
- **Test Execution Report** – results of test runs.
- **Defect Report** – bug ID, description, severity, status.
- **Test Summary Report** – overall testing status, coverage, pass/fail ratio.

### Automated vs Manual Testing

- **Manual Testing**: Executed by human testers, good for exploratory/ad-hoc testing.
- **Automated Testing**: Uses tools/scripts for regression, load, performance tests.
- **Tools**: Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, QTP, LoadRunner, JMeter.

### Defect Lifecycle (Bug Life Cycle)

1. New → Assigned → Open → Fixed → Retest → Verified → Closed.
2. If not fixed: can be Reopened, Deferred, or Rejected.

### Metrics in Testing

- **Defect Density** = Defects / Size of software.
- **Test Coverage** = (Executed tests / Total tests) × 100.
- **Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE)** = (Defects removed / Total defects) × 100.
- **MTTF (Mean Time to Failure)**.

### Standards for Testing

- **IEEE 829** – Test documentation.
- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119** – Software testing standards.
- **ISO/IEC 9126** – Software quality metrics.
### Challenges in Testing

- Limited time and resources.
- Changing requirements.
- Test environment issues.
- Maintaining automation scripts.
- Communication gaps with stakeholders.
    
### Best Practices

- Start testing early.
- Maintain traceability matrix (requirements ↔ test cases).
- Prioritize test cases by risk and criticality.
- Use automation for regression and performance tests.
- Regular reviews of test cases and plans.
- Continuous testing in DevOps/Agile.
