# Important Trees

1. **Binary Tree**:
   - A ==tree== where each node has ==at most two children==, typically referred to as the left and right child.

2. **Heap**:
   - A ==binary tree== used to ==implement priority queues.== The heap property requires that each ==node’s value be greater than or equal to the values of its children (for a max heap)== or less than or equal to the values of its children (for a min heap).

3. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
   - A ==binary tree ==where for each node, the ==left child’s value is less than the node’s value==, and the ==right child’s value is greater==. This property allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

3. **Balanced Binary Search Trees**:
   - **AVL Tree**: A ==self-balancing binary search tree== where the ==heights of two child subtrees of any node differ by== no more than one.
   - **Red-Black Tree**: A ==self-balancing binary search tree== with additional properties to ensure that the ==tree remains approximately balanced== during ==insertions and deletions.==

4. **B-Tree**:
   - A ==self-balancing tree== data structure that ==maintains sorted data== and ==allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions== in logarithmic time. It is commonly used in ==databases and file systems.==

5. **B+ Tree**:
   - A ==variation of the B-tree== where all ==values are stored at the leaf level==, and internal nodes only store keys. It is used extensively in ==database indexing.==

**More:**

7. **Segment Tree**:
   - A ==binary tree== used for answering range queries efficiently. It is often used for problems that involve querying sums or minimums over an interval of an array.

8. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**:
   - A tree-like data structure ==used to store associative data structures==, such as dictionaries. It is ohow ften used for string storage and retrieval.

9. **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)**:
   - A data structure that provides efficient methods for querying and updating prefix sums in an array.


# Classification of Trees Based on Structural Uniqueness ⭐


##### **A. Unique with Given Set of Values (Insertion Order Doesn’t Matter)**

These trees have a **fixed structure** for a given set of keys.

**1. Min Heap / Max Heap**
- **Min Heap / Max Heap** – Shape and heap property fix structure
- **Property:** Complete binary tree with heap property; structure fixed for given keys.  
- **Rule used:** insert at end (complete tree), then percolate-up (swap with parent while child < parent) to restore min-heap property.
- **Example (Min Heap):** Keys = {10, 20, 5, 6, 1}

- Insert 10
```
  10
  
Every Children < Parent : Rule Followed
```

- Insert 20
```
   10
  /
20

Every Children < Parent : Rule Followed
```

- Insert 5
```
   10
  / \    
20   5 

5(children) < 10(parent) : Swap

   5
  / \    
20   10
```

- Insert 6
```
     5 
    / \
  20  10 
  /
 6
 
6(children) < 20(parent) : Swap

     5 
    / \
   6  10 
  /
 20
 
Every Children < Parent : Rule Followed
```

- Insert 1
```
     5 
    / \
   6  10 
  / \
 20  1

1(children) < 6(parent) : Swap

     5 
    / \
   1  10 
  / \
 20  6
 
1(children) < 5(parent) : Swap

     1 
    / \
   5  10 
  / \
 20  6
 
Every Children < Parent : Rule Followed
```

**2. B Tree**
- **B Tree** – Deterministic splits make same structure
- **Property:** Deterministic node splits based on order and capacity (fixed structure for same keys).  
- **Rule:**
	- Each node can have **at most m–1 keys** and **m children**.
	- Each node (except root) must have **at least ⌈m/2⌉–1 keys**
	- **Keys in each node are sorted** in ascending order.
	- **Children are separated** by key ranges:
	    - All keys in the left subtree < parent key
	    - All keys in the right subtree > parent key
	- **Insertion** always happens at a **leaf**, then the tree may **split** upward if a node exceeds `m–1` keys.
- **Example (Order = 3):** Keys = {10, 20, 5, 6, 12}
- Definitions: order=3 ⇒ max children = 3 ⇒ max keys = 2, min keys = 1.

- Insert 10
```
[10]
```

- Insert 20 
```
[10,20]
```

- Insert 5 
```
[5, 10, 20]

3 keys > 2 ( max keys allowed) : split around median 10
  
  [10]
  /   \
[5]   [20]
```

Insert 6 
```
     [10]
    /    \
  [5,6]  [20]
```

Insert 12
```
     [10]
   /      \
[5,6]  [12,20]
```


**3. B+ Tree**
- **B+ Tree** – Deterministic leaf linking and splits fix structure
- **Property:** All data in leaf nodes, internal nodes only for indexing; unique structure for same keys.  
- **Example (Order = 3):** Keys = {10, 20, 5, 6, 12}

- Insert 10
```
[10]
```

- Insert 20
```
[10,20]
```

- Insert 5 
```
[5, 10, 20]

3 keys > 2 ( max keys allowed) : split around median 10 + New root created with separator key 10
  
  [10]
  /   \
[5]   [10,20]
```

Insert 6 
```
      [10]
    /     \
  [5,6]  [10,20]
```

Insert 12
```
     [10]
   /      \
[5,6]  [10,12,20]

3 keys > 2 ( max keys allowed) : split around median 12 + promoter separator key 12 to root

        [ 10 , 12 ]
       /     |      \
   [5,6]   [10,12]  [20]
   

Simplified (merged by display form): 
- [10,12] (two internal keys) is condensed to one split point [10]
- The right child [10,12] and its promoted key 12 are visually merged with the next leaf [20] to look simpler.
  

     [10]
    /    \
 [5,6]    [12,20]
```


**4. Trie / Prefix Tree**
- **Trie / Prefix Tree** – Depends only on key strings, not insertion order
- **Property:** Based purely on key patterns (characters/strings), not insertion order.  
- **Example:** (Keys = {"bat", "ball", "cat"}):

```
(root)
 ├─ b
 │   ├─ a
 │   │   ├─ l ─ l (end: ball)
 │   │   └─ t (end: bat)
 └─ c
     └─ a ─ t (end: cat)
```

##### **B. Unique Only for Given Insertion Order (Otherwise Different Structures Possible)**

These trees’ structure depends on **insertion sequence**.


**1. Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)** – Shape changes if insertion order changes
- **Property:** Shape changes with insertion sequence.  
- **Example:** 
- Insert Order 1: 10, 5, 15, 2, 7
```
      10
     /  \
    5    15
   / \
  2   7
```

- Insert Order 2: 5, 2, 10, 7, 15
```
      5
     / \
    2   10
       /  \
      7    15
```
- (Same values, different shape)

**2. AVL Tree**
- **AVL Tree** – Rotations depend on insertion order
- **Property:** Balanced BST; rotations depend on insertion order.  
- **Example:**
- Insert: 10, 20, 30  (Right rotation on 20 → final tree)
```
   20
  /  \
 10  30
```

- Insert: 30, 20, 10  (Left rotation on 20 → final tree)
```
   20
  /  \
 10  30
```
- (Same keys, different insertion order gives different rotation path)

**3. Red-Black Tree**
- **Red-Black Tree** – Color and rotation pattern depend on insertion order    
- **Property:** Balancing (color and rotation) depends on insertion order.  
- **Example:**  
- Insert: 10, 20, 30 → right rotation at 20  
- Insert: 20, 10, 30 → no rotation needed  
- Both yield different intermediate color/rotation steps.


**4. Splay Tree**
- **Splay Tree** – Final structure depends on access/insertion order
- **Property:** Final structure depends on the access or insertion sequence (recently accessed node moves to root).  
- **Example:**  
- Insert: 10, 20, 30 → After splaying, root = 30
```
   30
  /
 20
/
10
```

- Access 10 again → After splay, root = 10
```
  10
    \
     30
    /
   20
```
- (Same values but final shape depends on access/insertion pattern)
##### **C. Multiple Trees Even with Same Insertion Order**

These allow **variation even with same insert sequence**, due to non-deterministic balancing or tie-breaking.
- **Treap** – Random priorities cause different shapes
- **Skip List (as tree variant)** – Random level assignment changes structure
- **Randomized BST** – Uses randomization during insertion leading to multiple possible outcomes


# B-Tree and B+ - Tree
##### **B-Tree**
- A **self-balancing search tree** that maintains sorted data and allows searches, insertions, deletions, and sequential access in logarithmic time.
- **Used in databases and file systems.**

**Properties**
1. A B-Tree of **order m** can have:
    - **At most m children.**
    - **At most m−1 keys.**
    - **At least ⌈m/2⌉ children** (except root).
    - **At least ⌈m/2⌉−1 keys.**
        
2. All leaves appear at the same level.
3. Keys within a node are sorted in ascending order.
4. Subtrees between keys follow the same order property as in BST.
5. The root can have minimum 2 children (if not a leaf).
    

**Search**
- Similar to binary search within each node, then traverse the appropriate child.
- Time Complexity: **O(logₘ n)**
    
**Insertion**
- Insert key in proper leaf position.
- If overflow (more than m−1 keys) occurs → **split** the node.
- Middle key moves up to parent.

**Deletion**
- If underflow (less than ⌈m/2⌉−1 keys) occurs → **borrow** or **merge** from sibling.
- Maintain balance after each operation.

##### **B+ Tree**

- An **extension of B-Tree** used in databases for efficient range queries.
    
- All actual data is stored only in **leaf nodes**, internal nodes store **keys for indexing**.
    

**Properties**
1. A B+ Tree of **order d** can have:
    - **Between d and 2d keys per node.**
    - Hence, **between d+1 and 2d+1 children.**
    - Root has at least 2 children if not a leaf.
2. **Leaf nodes are linked** to form a **linked list** for sequential access.
3. All leaves appear at the same level.
4. Searching uses internal nodes; data found in leaves.

**Search**
- Traverse internal nodes like B-Tree → reach leaf → fetch actual record.
- Time Complexity: **O(logₙ)**
    
**Insertion**
- Insert in leaf → if overflow (more than 2d keys) → **split** leaf.
- Middle key copied to parent (not moved).

**Deletion**
- Remove from leaf → if underflow (< d keys) → **borrow or merge** → update parent keys.

**Differences Between B-Tree and B+ Tree**

| Feature            | B-Tree                     | B+ Tree                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Data Storage       | In internal and leaf nodes | Only in leaf nodes                 |
| Leaf Linking       | Not linked                 | Linked sequentially                |
| Range Queries      | Less efficient             | Very efficient                     |
| Access Path Length | Variable                   | Always same (leaves at same level) |
| Redundancy         | No repetition of keys      | Keys may repeat in internal nodes  |
| Search Efficiency  | Slower for range           | Faster for range queries           |

**Order Terminology Summary**

|Convention|Definition|Keys per Node|Children per Node|
|---|---|---|---|
|B-Tree (order = m)|m = Max children|⌈m/2⌉−1 … m−1|⌈m/2⌉ … m|
|B+ Tree (order = d)|d = Min keys|d … 2d|d+1 … 2d+1|

# Data Structures by Use Case

##### 1. **In-Memory Searching and Storage**

**Trees/Graphs Used:**

- Binary Search Tree (BST) – simple in-memory search, insert, delete
- AVL Tree – balanced BST for guaranteed O(log n) search
- Red-Black Tree – balanced BST with faster insertion/deletion
- Hash Tables – fast key-value access (not a tree, but common)

##### 2. **Disk-Based Databases / File Systems**

**Trees/Graphs Used:**
- B-Tree – disk-friendly, keeps tree shallow for fewer I/Os
- B+ Tree – all data in leaves, linked leaves for range queries

**Dense vs Shallow Indexing**
- **B-Tree:** Can store keys and data in all nodes (internal + leaves). Used when you want **shallow indexing**, i.e., fewer levels to search for a key, but range queries are less efficient because data is scattered across nodes.
    
- **B+ Tree:** Stores all actual data only in the **leaf nodes**, while internal nodes only store keys for navigation. Leaf nodes are linked, making it **better for dense data and range queries**. It’s also more disk-efficient because internal nodes can have a higher fan-out, keeping the tree shallower.
##### 3. **Priority Management**

**Trees/Graphs Used:**
- Heap (Min/Max) – efficient access to smallest/largest element
- Fibonacci Heap – faster amortized decrease-key for algorithms like Dijkstra

##### 4. **String Storage and Searching**

**Trees/Graphs Used:**
- Trie (Prefix Tree) – fast prefix search and autocomplete
- Suffix Tree / Suffix Array – substring search, pattern matching

#### 5. **Graph Modeling and Network Analysis**

**Trees/Graphs Used:**
- Adjacency List – sparse graph representation
- Adjacency Matrix – dense graph representation
- Directed/Undirected Graphs – for connectivity and path finding

##### 6. **Range Queries / Interval Problems**

**Trees/Graphs Used:**
- Segment Tree – range sum/min/max queries with updates
- Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) – efficient prefix sums
    

##### 7. **Connectivity / Disjoint Components**

**Trees/Graphs Used:**
- Disjoint Set (Union-Find) – track connected components in a graph
    
##### 8. **Spatial Data / Geometric Problems**

**Trees/Graphs Used:**
