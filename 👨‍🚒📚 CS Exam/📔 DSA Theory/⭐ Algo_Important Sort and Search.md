##### **Comparison Sort and Alternatives**

**Fastest Sort : Quick Sort** -> `TC:O(n*logn)`

>**Comparison Sorting**

Quicksort usually has a running time of `n x log(n)`, but is there an algorithm that can sort even faster? In general, this is not possible. Most sorting algorithms are comparison sorts, i.e. they sort a list just by comparing the elements to one another. A comparison sort algorithm cannot beat `n x log(n)` (worst-case) running time, since `n x log(n)` represents the minimum number of comparisons needed to know where to place each element. For more details, you can see these notes (PDF).

>**Alternative Sorting**

Another sorting method, the counting sort, does not require comparison. Instead, you create an integer array whose index range covers the entire range of values in your array to sort. Each time a value occurs in the original array, you increment the counter at that index. At the end, run through your counting array, printing the value of each non-zero valued index that number of times.

##### **Stable  vs Unstable Sort**

**Stable Sorting:**  If two elements have the same key (equal value), their **relative order** in the original array is preserved in the sorted output.

**Unstable Sorting:**  If two equal elements may **change their relative order** after sorting.

**Example:**  
Array = `[4a, 3, 4b, 2]` (4a and 4b are equal but distinct items)
- **Stable sort result:** `[2, 3, 4a, 4b]` (order of 4a before 4b is preserved)
- **Unstable sort result:** `[2, 3, 4b, 4a]` (order of equal elements changed)

##### **Stable Sorting Algorithms**

- **Bubble Sort** → ✅ Stable → Swaps only adjacent elements, so equal elements never cross order.
- **Insertion Sort** → ✅ Stable → Inserts element into sorted part without jumping equal elements ahead.
- **Merge Sort** → ✅ Stable → During merge, if equal, it takes the left one first (preserves original order).
- **Counting Sort** → ✅ Stable → Places elements in output array in order of input traversal.
- **Radix Sort** → ✅ Stable → Relies on Counting Sort as subroutine, which is stable.
- **Bucket Sort** → ✅ Stable (if stable sub-sort like Insertion is used inside buckets).
- **TimSort** → ✅ Stable → Designed to be stable (merge + insertion hybrid).
- **Cocktail Shaker Sort** → ✅ Stable → Bidirectional Bubble Sort, still only adjacent swaps.
- **Odd-Even Sort** → ✅ Stable → Adjacent comparisons like Bubble, order preserved.
- **C++ stable_sort** → ✅ Stable → Explicitly implemented to keep equal order (uses Merge-like logic).

##### **Unstable Sorting Algorithms**

- ==**Selection Sort**== → ❌ Unstable → Swaps non-adjacent elements; equal elements can jump over each other.
- ==**Quick Sort**== → ❌ Unstable → Partition step may reorder equal elements around pivot.
- ==**Heap Sort**== → ❌ Unstable → Heapify swaps elements far apart, disturbing order of equals.
- **Shell Sort** → ❌ Unstable → Elements are moved across large gaps, breaking order of equals.
- **IntroSort (STL sort)** → ❌ Unstable → Based on Quick + Heap + Insertion, instability inherited.
- **Tournament Sort** → ❌ Unstable → Equal elements may be promoted/replaced in tree arbitrarily.

👉 **Shortcut to remember:**
- Most **O(n²) simple sorts**: Bubble (stable), Insertion (stable), ==Selection (unstable)==.
- Most **O(n log n) divide & conquer sorts**: Merge (stable), ==Quick (unstable)==, ==Heap (unstable)==.
- **Counting/Radix/Bucket** → stable, because they don’t rely only on comparisons.

👉 **Shortcut Rule**:
- Algorithms that ==**only swap neighbors**== (Bubble, Insertion, Odd-Even) → ==**Stable**==.
- Algorithms that ==**move elements far apart**== (Selection, Quick, Heap, Shell) → ==**Unstable**==.
##### **In-place vs Out-of-place Sorting** 

**In-place Sorting Algorithms** (Use only constant or O(1) extra space, besides recursion stack)
- **Bubble Sort** → In-place
- **Insertion Sort** → In-place
- **Selection Sort** → In-place
- **Quick Sort** → In-place (needs recursion stack O(log n))
- **Heap Sort** → In-place
- **Shell Sort** → In-place
- **IntroSort** (C++ STL sort) → In-place
    
**Out-of-place Sorting Algorithms** (Require extra arrays or large auxiliary space, $O(n)$ or more)
- **Merge Sort** → Out-of-place (needs $O(n)$ auxiliary array)
- **Counting Sort** → Out-of-place (needs $O(n+k)$ array)
- **Radix Sort** → Out-of-place (needs counting arrays + temporary storage)
- **Bucket Sort** → Out-of-place (needs buckets)
- **TimSort** → Out-of-place (needs temporary arrays)
- **External Merge Sort** → Out-of-place (disk-based, very large data)
    

👉 **Shortcut rule:**
- Simple ==“swap-based” sorts== (Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Quick, Heap, Shell) → ==**In-place**==
- ==“Auxiliary-array based” sorts== (Merge, Counting, Radix, Bucket, TimSort) → ==**Out-of-place**==
