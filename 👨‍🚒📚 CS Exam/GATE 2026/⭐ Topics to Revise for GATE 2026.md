**1. Mathematics**
- **Probability**
	- Independent vs Exhaustive event
	- Independent Property (P(A∩B) = P(A)P(B))
	- Exhaustive Property (A∪B = S)
	- Bayes Theorem
	- Probability (tough formula problems)
	- Eigen value
- **Algebra**
	- Group, Ring, Monoid, Abelian
    
**2. OS**
- User Mode vs Kernel Mode
- User level thread vs Kernel level thread
- RISC vs CISC
- Memory mapping, Paging

**3. CN**
- CRC, Parity, Single Parity, 2D Parity, Checksum
- CRC vs Checksum vs Parity
- Go-Back-N
- Selective Repeat (window size)
- ARQ
    - Efficiency %
    - Max window size
    - `U = W × Tt / (Tt + 2Tp)`
        
- Token Ring, Monitor
- Data Link Layer -> LLC & MAC
- Loopback Addressing

**4. DBMS**
- Rollback even when transaction is read only?    
- Conflict, Conflict Serializable, Recoverable etc notes
- Normalisation Forms Revision
    - Lossless vs Lossy Decomposition
    - Anomalies in different NF
- SQL LIKE: `_` and `%`
- Inverted File Organisations

**5. COA**
- Explicit / Implicit Numbering
- Mantissa, Exponent, Floating point representation etc
- Instruction numericals + memory numericals
- Cache Average Access Time
    - simultaneous access and hierarchical access
- Assembler Directive
- Daisy Chaining

- D Latch
- Fraction to Binary
- 2's Complement and Sign Extension
- K-map
    - SOP / POS
    - Minterm / Maxterm

**7. TOC**
- NFA to DFA conversion: DFA can have up to `2^n` states for NFA with `n` states
- DFA vs NFA state complexity (DFA >= 2^n states, NFA >= N states)


**8. CD**
- Closure Rule Revision (specially CFG)

**9. Algorithm**
- Heap, BST etc. Sequence of Insertion vs Uniqueness
- Heap properties/formulas (why heap array is not ascending/descending sorted)
- Hashing - Types of Hashing Techniques
- Big O, Big Omega, Big Theta
- Graphs, tree min height, distance etc dependency formula (in my notes)
- Master’s Theorem
