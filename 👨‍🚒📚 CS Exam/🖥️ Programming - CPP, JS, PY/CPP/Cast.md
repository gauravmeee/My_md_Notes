Good question. Let’s break it clearly:

### `int*`

- Declares a **pointer to int**.
    
- Example:
    
    ```c
    int* p;  // p can point to an integer
    ```
    

### `(int*)`

- This is a **type cast** operator.
    
- It tells the compiler: "Treat this value as a pointer to int".
    
- Example with `malloc`:
    
    ```c
    int* p = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int));
    ```
    

Here, `malloc` returns a `void*` (generic pointer). In **C**:

- `void*` can be assigned to any pointer type **without cast**.
    
- So this works fine too:
    
    ```c
    int* p = malloc(sizeof(int));
    ```
    

In **C++**:

- Implicit conversion from `void*` to other pointers is **not allowed**.
    
- That’s why we must use `(int*)malloc(...)` in C++.
    

### Summary

- In **C**: Cast is optional → `int* p = malloc(sizeof(int));` (preferred).
    
- In **C++**: Cast is required → `int* p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));`
    
- Modern C++ avoids `malloc` and uses `new`/`delete`.
    

Do you want me to also show the **difference between malloc+free vs new+delete** in C++?
