Stacks and queues are fundamental data structures used in programming. Here's how you can use them in Python:

### Stack
A stack is a collection that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. You can use a list or the `collections.deque` class to implement a stack.

#### Using a List
```python
# Stack implementation using a list
stack = []

# Push elements onto the stack
stack.append(1)
stack.append(2)
stack.append(3)

# Pop elements from the stack
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 3
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 2
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 1
```

#### Using `collections.deque`
deque: double-ended queue;
```python
from collections import deque

# Stack implementation using deque
stack = deque()

# Push elements onto the stack
stack.append(1)
stack.append(2)
stack.append(3)

# Pop elements from the stack
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 3
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 2
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 1
```

### Queue
A queue is a collection that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. You can also use a list or the `collections.deque` class to implement a queue.

#### Using a List
```python
# Queue implementation using a list
queue = []

# Enqueue elements
queue.append(1)
queue.append(2)
queue.append(3)

# Dequeue elements
print(queue.pop(0))  # Output: 1
print(queue.pop(0))  # Output: 2
print(queue.pop(0))  # Output: 3
```

#### Using `collections.deque`
```python
from collections import deque

# Queue implementation using deque
queue = deque()

# Enqueue elements
queue.append(1)
queue.append(2)
queue.append(3)

# Dequeue elements
print(queue.popleft())  # Output: 1
print(queue.popleft())  # Output: 2
print(queue.popleft())  # Output: 3
```

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - **Lists**:
     - **Append**: O(1)
     - **Pop from end**: O(1)
     - **Pop from front**: O(n) (inefficient for queues)
   - **Deque**:
     - **Append**: O(1) (both ends)
     - **Pop**: O(1) (both ends, efficient for queues)

2. **Functionality**:
   - **Deque** allows efficient operations from both ends, making it versatile for implementing various data structures.
   - **Thread-Safety**: Deque operations are designed to be thread-safe.

### Use Cases
- **Stacks**: Both lists and deques can be used effectively.
- **Queues**: Deque is preferred for better performance in enqueue and dequeue operations.

### Conclusion
Use **lists** for stack implementations and **deque** for queues or when needing efficiency in adding/removing elements from both ends.
