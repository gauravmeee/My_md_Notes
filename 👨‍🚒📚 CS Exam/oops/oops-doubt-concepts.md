# OOPS Doubt Concepts

## Why C is not a OOPS if it have STRUCT

A struct in C only groups data. That’s it.\
A class in OOP bundles data **and** functions, plus features like encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.

C has:\
• struct =collection of variables\
• no member functions bound to struct\
• no access control (public/private)\
• no inheritance\
• no virtual behavior or runtime polymorphism

So C supports **data grouping**, not **object-oriented principles**.

You can implement OOP patterns manually in C, but the language itself doesn’t provide OOP mechanisms. Therefore C is **not object oriented**.
