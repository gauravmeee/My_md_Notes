##### **Why C is not a OOPS if it have STRUCT**
A struct in C only groups data. That’s it.  
A class in OOP bundles data **and** functions, plus features like encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.

C has:  
• struct = collection of variables  
• no member functions bound to struct  
• no access control (public/private)  
• no inheritance  
• no virtual behavior or runtime polymorphism

So C supports **data grouping**, not **object-oriented principles**.

You can implement OOP patterns manually in C, but the language itself doesn’t provide OOP mechanisms. Therefore C is **not object oriented**.
