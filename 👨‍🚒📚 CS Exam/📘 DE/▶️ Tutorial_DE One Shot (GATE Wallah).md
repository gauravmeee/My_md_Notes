### **1. Introduction**

The session will cover:

- Theorems and Gates.
- Combinational Circuits (Mux, K-Map, Comparator, Full Adder, Half Adder).
- Sequential Circuits (Latches, Flip-Flops, Asynchronous & Synchronous Counters).
- Miscellaneous topics like Number Systems and possibly ADC/DAC if time permits.

### **2. Basic Theorems and Gates**

The focus is on the most important theorems for revision.

##### 2.1 Fundamental Boolean Algebra Theorems

- **`1 + Anything = 1`**
    - If a Boolean expression involves OR operations and contains a '1', the result is always '1'.
    - **Example**: `1 + A + B' + C` will simplify to `1`.

- **`0 * Anything = 0`**
    - If a Boolean expression involves AND operations and contains a '0', the result is always '0'.
    - **Example**: `0 * A * B' * C` will simplify to `0`.

- **`A + A' = 1`** and **`A * A' = 0`**
    - A variable `OR`ed with its complement is always '`1`'.
    - A variable `AND`ed with its complement is always '`0`'.
    - These are crucial for simplification.
    - **Example**: `A' + B' + AB`
        - This can be written as `(AB)' + AB` using **==De Morgan's theorem.==**
        - Applying `X' + X = 1`, the result is `1`.

- **Associative Property for OR and AND Operations**
    - The order of operations does not affect the result.
    - **Example**: `A + B + C` can be `(A + B) + C` or `A + (B + C)`.
    - **Example**: `A * B * C` can be `(A * B) * C` or `A * (B * C)`.

##### 2.2 Distributive Theorem

- **AND over OR (Normal Distributive Law)**
    - `A * (B + C) = A * B + A * C`.
    - This is intuitive, like basic algebra.

- **OR over AND (Boolean Algebra Specific)**
    - **==`A + (B * C) = (A + B) * (A + C) `==** ⭐
    - **This is a very important theorem**, used extensively in GATE questions.
    - **Reverse Direction Application**: This theorem is frequently asked in its reverse form, where multiple brackets are multiplied, and a common term exists.
        - If common term is `A`, then ==`(A + B) * (A + C)` can be simplified to `A + BC`. ==⭐

    - **Numerical Example for Reverse Direction**:
        - `F = (A + B + C') * (A + B' + C) * (A + B + C)`
        - **Step 1**: Operate on the first two brackets. Notice `(A + B)` is common in the first and third bracket, but it's better to operate on two at a time.
        - Consider the first two: `(A + B + C') * (A + B' + C)`
            - Common term is `A`. What remains are `B + C'` and `B' + C`.
            - Applying the reverse distributive law: `A + (B + C') * (B' + C)`
            - Now simplify `(B + C') * (B' + C)` using the cross-product theorem (discussed later) or simply by expanding:
                - `BB' + BC + C'B' + C'C`
                - `0 + BC + B'C' + 0`
                - `BC + B'C'` (This is B XNOR C)
            - So the first two brackets simplify to `A + (BC + B'C')`.
        - **Step 2**: Multiply this result with the third bracket: `(A + BC + B'C') * (A + B + C)`
            - Here, `A` is common.
            - Applying the reverse distributive law again: `A + (BC + B'C') * (B + C)`
            - Now simplify `(BC + B'C') * (B + C)`:
                - `BC * B + BC * C + B'C' * B + B'C' * C`
                - `BC + BC + 0 + 0` (since `BB=B`, `CC=C`, `B'B=0`, `C'C=0`)
                - `BC`
            - So the final result is **`A + BC`**.

##### 2.3 Absorption/Redundancy Theorem

- **Theorem**: `A + A'C + BC = A + A'C` (where ==`BC` is the redundant term==).

- **Conditions for Applicability**:
    1. At least one variable must be present in **both complemented and uncomplemented forms** (e.g., `A` and `A'`).
    2. The product of the remaining variables (those not in complemented/uncomplemented pair) must be present as a term.

- **Example 1**: `A + A'C + BC`
    - `A` and `A'` are present.
    - Remaining variables are `B` (with `A`) and `C` (with `A'`).
    - Their product `BC` is present.
    - Therefore, ==`BC` is the **redundant term**== and can be removed.
    - Result: `A + A'C`.

- **Example 2**: `A'C + BC' + A'B`
    - **Identify complemented/uncomplemented pair**: Only `C` and `C'` are present in both forms.
    - **Check remaining terms**: With `C`, `A'` remains. With `C'`, `B` remains. Is their product `A'B` present? Yes.
    - Therefore, ==`A'B` is the **redundant== term**.
    - Result: `A'C + BC'`.
    - **Note**: The redundant term is not always the last term.

- **Example 3 (Non-Applicable Redundancy)**: `A'C + BC' + ABC`
    - `C` and `C'` are present.
    - Remaining terms are `A'` and `B`. Their product is `A'B`.
    - `ABC` is present, not `A'B`. So, ==Redundancy Theorem does not directly apply== here.
    - **Alternative Simplification (Distributive Law)**:
        - `A'C + BC' + ABC`
        - Take `A` common from `A'C` (oops, mistake by speaker, `A` cannot be taken common from `A'C`).
        - The speaker then took `A` common from `ABC` to form `A(BC)`.
        - Let's re-evaluate the speaker's logic for `A'C + BC' + ABC`.
        - They say: `A'C + B(C' + AC)`. Speaker's solution path for this example on transcript `A'C + BC' + ABC` was to note `Redundancy Theorem Not Applicable`. Then, they tried to identify `A` common from some terms. The example they worked on was `A'B + A'C + BC`.
        - The actual solution given for `A'C + BC' + ABC` was `A + BC` by combining `A + B + C'` and `A + B' + C` which is a different example.
        - For `A'C + BC' + ABC`, the actual simplification path might be taking `C` common: `C(A' + AB) + BC'`.
            - `A' + AB = A' + B` (Absorption Law: `X' + XY = X' + Y`).
            - So, `C(A' + B) + BC'`
            - `A'C + BC + BC'`
            - `A'C + B(C + C')`
            - `A'C + B(1)`
            - `A'C + B`.
        - This shows that even if Redundancy Theorem doesn't apply, other theorems might.

##### 2.4 Cross-Product Theorem (Consensus Theorem - `AB + BC + C'A = AB + C'A`)

- **Theorem**: `(A + B) * (A' + C) = AC + A'B`
    - This theorem applies when two brackets are in product, and one variable exists in both complemented and uncomplemented forms (e.g., `A` and `A'`).
    - The terms `A*A'` become `0`. The remaining terms `AC` and `A'B` are the result.
    - In essence, this is an application of distribution: `AA' + AC + BA' + BC = 0 + AC + A'B + BC`. Here, `BC` is the redundant term.
    - **Reverse Version (Important)**: If you have an expression like `A'B' + AC'`, you can convert it back to `(A' + C') * (B' + A)` (re-order `(A + B')`).
        - To apply the reverse: Identify a variable present in both complemented and uncomplemented forms (`A` and `A'`). This variable will appear in separate brackets.
        - `A'B' + AC'` (Here `A` and `A'` are the variables).
        - One bracket will have `A'`, another will have `A`.
        - `A'` is with `B'`, so `(A' + B')`.
        - `A` is with `C'`, so `(A + C')`.
        - Result: **`(A' + B') * (A + C')`**.

### **3. Logic Gates**

- **Multi-Input Property**: For an N-input AND gate:
    - **Output will be ==1 ONLY IF ALL the inputs are High== (1)**.
    - **If ANY ONE of the inputs is Zero, the output will DEFINITELY be Zero**, regardless of other inputs.
- **Enable/Disable Input**:
    - **Enable Input: 1** (If one input is permanently held at 1, the output will reflect the AND of the other inputs, enabling the gate's function).
    - **Disable Input: 0** (If one input is permanently held at 0, the output will always be 0, disabling the gate's function).
- **Laws**: Holds **Commutative Law** (`A.B = B.A`) and **Associative Law** (`A.(B.C) = (A.B).C`).

#### 3.2 OR Gate

- **Multi-Input Property**: For an N-input OR gate:
    - **Output will be ==0 ONLY IF ALL the inputs are Low== (0)**.
    - **If ANY ONE of the inputs is One, the output will DEFINITELY be One**, regardless of other inputs.
- **Enable/Disable Input**:
    - **Enable Input: 0** (If one input is permanently held at 0, the output will reflect the OR of the other inputs, enabling the gate's function).
    - **Disable Input: 1** (If one input is permanently held at 1, the output will always be 1, disabling the gate's function).
- **Laws**: Holds **Commutative Law** (`A+B = B+A`) and **Associative Law** (`A+(B+C) = (A+B)+C`).
- **Special Theorem**: `P + P * Anything = P`
    - This is not a fundamental theorem but a very useful identity for simplification.
    - **Example**: `A + A * B` simplifies to `A`.

#### 3.3 NAND Gate

**Symbol** & **Truth Table (2-Input)**: 

![](https://signoffsemiconductors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/nand-1-300x141.png)

- **Construction**: **AND gate followed by a NOT gate** (`AND + NOT`).
- **Output Expressions**:
    - `Y = (A . B)'`
    - Using De Morgan's Theorem: `Y = A' + B'`
    - For multi-input (e.g., 3-input): `Y = (A . B . C)'` or `Y = A' + B' + C'`.
- **Output Writing Technique**:
    - Method 1: Multiply all inputs, then take the whole complement.
    - Method 2: **Invert each input, then add them** (useful when inputs are already complemented).
        - **Example**: `NAND(A_bar, B_bar)` will be `A + B` (A_bar inverted is A, B_bar inverted is B, then add).
        - **Example**: `NAND(A, B_bar, C_bar)` will be `A_bar + B + C`.

- **Multi-Input Property**: For an N-input NAND gate:
    - **Output will be 0 ONLY IF ALL the inputs are High (1)**.
    - **If ANY ONE of the inputs is Zero, the output will DEFINITELY be One**, regardless of other inputs.
- **Enable/Disable Input**: **Same as AND gate**.
    - **Enable Input: 1**
    - **Disable Input: 0**.
    - _Rationale_: If a NAND gate's AND part is enabled/disabled, the NOT part just inverts the result, maintaining the overall enable/disable behavior.
- **Laws**: Holds **Commutative Law** (`(A.B)' = (B.A)'`). **Does NOT hold Associative Law**.

#### 3.4 NOR Gate

- **Output Expressions**:
    - `Y = (A + B)'`
    - Using De Morgan's Theorem: `Y = A' . B'`
    - For multi-input (e.g., 3-input): `Y = (A + B + C)'` or `Y = A' . B' . C'`.
- **Output Writing Technique**:

    - Method 2: **Invert each input, then multiply them** (useful when inputs are already complemented).
        - **Example**: `NOR(A_bar, B_bar)` will be `A . B`.
        - **Example**: `NOR(A, B_bar, C_bar)` will be `A_bar . B . C`.

- **Multi-Input Property**: For an N-input NOR gate:

- **Enable/Disable Input**: **Same as OR gate**.
    - **Enable Input: 0**
    - **Disable Input: 1**.
- **Laws**: Holds **Commutative Law** (`(A+B)' = (B+A)'`). **Does NOT hold Associative Law**.

#### 3.5 XOR Gate

**Symbol** & **Truth Table (2-Input)**: 

![](https://signoffsemiconductors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/xor-1-300x164.png)


- **Construction (from basic gates)**:
    - `A XOR B = A'B + AB'`
    - **Diagram**: AND gates generate `A'B` and `AB'`, followed by an OR gate.
- **Definition**:
    - **Output is 1 when the inputs are DIFFERENT** (0 XOR 1 = 1, 1 XOR 0 = 1).
    - **Output is 0 when the inputs are SAME** (0 XOR 0 = 0, 1 XOR 1 = 0).

- **Multi-Input XOR**:
    - **NOT directly defined**. It's always calculated by applying the XOR operation **two inputs at a time** using the **Associative Law**.
    - **Example**: `A XOR B XOR C` is calculated as `(A XOR B) XOR C`.
    - **Symmetry (Odd Number of Ones Detector)**: When calculating multi-input XOR, an observation (not a definition) is that the output is 1 if the total number of '1's in the input is **odd**, and 0 if the total number of '1's is **even**.
- **Laws**: Holds **Commutative Law** (`A XOR B = B XOR A`) and **Associative Law** (`A XOR (B XOR C) = (A XOR B) XOR C`).

- **Properties**:
    - **`A XOR A = 0`** (Same inputs, output 0).
    - **`A XOR A' = 1`** (Different inputs, output 1).
    - **`A XOR 0 = A`** (Acts as a buffer).
    - **`A XOR 1 = A'`** (Acts as an inverter).
    - **Exchange Property**: If `A XOR B = C`, then `A XOR C = B` (and `B XOR C = A`).
- **Important Special Properties**:
    - `A XOR B XOR AB = A + B`.
    - `A XOR B XOR (A + B) = AB`.
- **Distributive Law for XOR (Does NOT Hold)**: XOR operation **cannot be distributed** over AND or OR operations (`A XOR (B + C)` is NOT `(A XOR B) + (A XOR C)`).
    - **Correct Way to Solve `A XOR (A + B)`**:
        - Treat `A` as the first term and `(A + B)` as the second.
        - Apply `First' * Second + First * Second'`
        - `A' * (A + B) + A * (A + B)'`
        - `A'A + A'B + A * (A'B')` (using De Morgan's for `(A + B)'`)
        - `0 + A'B + AA'B'`
        - `A'B + 0`
        - Result: **`A'B`**.

#### 3.6 XNOR Gate

**Symbol** & **Truth Table (2-Input)**: 

![](https://www.electronics-tutorial.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/XNOR1.png)


- **Construction (from basic gates)**:
    - `A XNOR B = A'B' + AB`
    - **Diagram**: AND gates generate `A'B'` and `AB`, followed by an OR gate.
- **Definition**:
    - **Output is 1 when the inputs are SAME** (0 XNOR 0 = 1, 1 XNOR 1 = 1).
    - **Output is 0 when the inputs are DIFFERENT** (0 XNOR 1 = 0, 1 XNOR 0 = 0).
- **Relation to XOR**: **XNOR is the complement of XOR** (`A XNOR B = (A XOR B)'`).
- **Multi-Input XNOR**:
    - **NOT directly defined**. Calculated using Associative Law (two inputs at a time).
    - **Symmetry**:
        - For **Odd number of input lines**: XNOR acts as an **Odd Number of Ones Detector** (output 1 if odd number of 1s, 0 if even number of 1s). In this case, `A XNOR B XNOR C` is equal to `A XOR B XOR C`.
        - For **Even number of input lines**: XNOR acts as an **Even Number of Ones Detector** (output 1 if even number of 1s, 0 if odd number of 1s). In this case, `A XNOR B XNOR C XNOR D` is equal to `(A XOR B XOR C XOR D)'`.

- **Properties**:
    - **`A XNOR A = 1`** (Same inputs, output 1).
    - **`A XNOR A' = 0`** (Different inputs, output 0).
    - **`A XNOR 0 = A'`**.
    - **`A XNOR 1 = A`**.
    - **Exchange Property**: If `A XNOR B = C`, then `A XNOR C = B` (and `B XNOR C = A`).

#### 3.7 Mixed Properties of XOR and XNOR

![](https://digilent.com/reference/_media/learn/fundamentals/digital-logic/xor-and-xnor/xorxnorcmos.png)

- **Complementing one input**:
    - `A XOR B' = A XNOR B`.
    - `A' XOR B = A XNOR B`.
    - `A XNOR B' = A XOR B`.
    - `A' XNOR B = A XOR B`.

- **Complementing both inputs**:
    - `A' XOR B' = A XOR B`.
    - `A' XNOR B' = A XNOR B`.

- **General Complement Property (Number of Bars)**:
    - Count the total number of complement bars on variables and whole expressions.
    - If the **total count of bars is EVEN**, the gate type **remains the same** (XOR remains XOR, XNOR remains XNOR). Remove all bars.
    - If the **total count of bars is ODD**, the gate type **flips** (XOR becomes XNOR, XNOR becomes XOR). Remove all bars.
    - **Example**: `A XOR B XOR (C' XOR D)'` (A has 0 bars, B has 0 bars, C has 1 bar, D has 0 bars, the whole (C' XOR D) has 1 bar. Total bars = 1+1 = 2 (EVEN)).
        - Result: `A XOR B XOR C XOR D`.
    - **Example (Complex)**: `(A XOR B_bar XOR C_bar)' XOR (D_bar XOR E)'`
        - Count bars: A (0), B (1), C (1), D (1), E (0). Whole bars: 1, 1.
        - Total bars = 1+1+1+1 = 4 (EVEN).
        - Result: `A XOR B XOR C XOR D XOR E`.
    - **Example (from video)**: `A XOR B' XOR C' XOR A XNOR B'`
        - Using the property: `A XNOR B'` is `A XOR B` (one bar flips XNOR to XOR).
        - Expression becomes: `A XOR B' XOR C' XOR (A XOR B)`
        - Regrouping similar terms (Associative and Commutative properties hold for XOR):
        - `(A XOR A) XOR (B' XOR B) XOR C'`
        - `0 XOR 1 XOR C'`
        - `1 XOR C'`
        - Result: `C` (since `1 XOR X = X'`).

### 4. Minimum Number of NAND/NOR Gates

#### 4.1 NAND Implementation

- **Basic Gate Implementations with 2-Input NANDs**:
    
    - **NOT**: 1 NAND (connect both inputs to the variable).
    - **AND**: 2 NANDs.
    - **OR**: 3 NANDs.

![](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/digital-electronics/images/implementation-of-or-gate-from-nand-gate-3.jpg)


- **Methodology for Function Implementation**:
    
    1. **Function must be in SOP format**.

    2. **Check for "Hidden NANDs"**: Look for terms of the form `(X' + Y')` which is `(X.Y)'` (inverted OR). These simplify to a single NAND gate. Hidden NANDs can be found by taking common terms or using inverse transpose property.

    3. **If no Hidden NANDs**:
        - Take the **complement of the function (F')**. This converts OR operations to AND operations and product terms to NAND-like forms using De Morgan's Law.
        - Implement F' using NANDs.
        - Finally, invert F' to get F (using 1 NAND for NOT operation).

- **Example 1 (No Hidden NANDs)**: `F = A'B + BC`
    - Take F': `F' = (A'B + BC)' = (A'B)' . (BC)'`
    - Count NANDs:
        - `A'B`: Requires 1 NAND for `A'`, then 1 NAND for `(A'B)'` = **2 NANDs**.
        - `BC`: Requires 1 NAND for `(BC)'` = **1 NAND**.
        - Let `P = (A'B)'` and `Q = (BC)'`. We need to implement `P.Q`. This is `(P.Q)'` which is `P''+Q''` then `(P.Q)'''`. This is complex.
        - **Better way for F'**:
            - Need to generate `A'` (1 NAND).
            - Need `(A'B)'` (1 NAND, using `A'` and `B`). Let this be `X`.
            - Need `(BC)'` (1 NAND, using `B` and `C`). Let this be `Y`.
            - Now we have `X` and `Y`. We need to compute `X.Y`. This is `((X.Y)')'`. This requires two NANDs for the AND operation.
            - **Total**: 1 (for A') + 1 (for X) + 1 (for Y) + 2 (for X.Y) = **5 NANDs**.
        - The speaker's count of 4 for `A'B + BC` might be an optimized implementation not directly following the F' then invert.
            - `A'B`: requires `A'` (1 NAND), then `A'.B` is `((A'.B)')'` (2 NANDs).
            - `BC`: `(BC)'` (1 NAND), then `((BC)')'` (2 NANDs).
            - Then `(A'B) + (BC)` requires 3 NANDs for OR.
            - Total = `(1+2) + (1+2) + 3` = 9 NANDs if implemented separately and ORed.
            - The typical approach is `F = ((A'B)' . (BC)')'`.
                - `A'` (1 NAND)
                - `(A'B)'` (1 NAND, output is `X`)
                - `(BC)'` (1 NAND, output is `Y`)
                - `(X . Y)'` (1 NAND, gives `( (A'B)' . (BC)' )' = A'B + BC`)
                - **Total = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 NANDs.** This matches the speaker's count for this specific example.

- **Example 2 (With Hidden NANDs)**: `F = (A.B)'B + C'`    
    - Speaker used `F = (A.B)' + B'C'` for the example (after the `(A.B)'B + C'` mistake). Let's use `F = (A.B)' + B'C'`.
    - Recognize `(A.B)'` as a hidden NAND. This requires 1 NAND. Let it be `R`.
    - Recognize `B'C'` as `(B+C)'` (inverted OR, which is a hidden NAND). This requires `B'` (1 NAND) and `C'` (1 NAND), then 1 NAND for `(B'C')` using these, or 1 NAND if you view it as `(B+C)'` if inputs are B and C directly (not the case here).
    - **Correction based on typical hidden NAND recognition**: A hidden NAND usually refers to an expression directly in `(XY)'` form or an inverted OR form like `X'+Y'` or `(X+Y)'`.
    - The speaker's example from was `(A.B)' + (B.C)'`. This is two NAND terms ORed together.
    - `F = (A.B)' + (B.C)'` (Let `X = (A.B)'`, `Y = (B.C)'`). We need `X+Y`.
    - To implement `X+Y` using NANDs: `(X'.Y')'`.
        - `X'` means `((A.B)')'` which simplifies to `A.B`. This requires 2 NANDs.
        - `Y'` means `((B.C)')'` which simplifies to `B.C`. This requires 2 NANDs.
        - Then `(X'.Y')'` requires 1 NAND.
        - Total = `2 + 2 + 1 = 5 NANDs`. This matches the speaker's result for that type of expression where terms are already NANDed.

- **Example 3 (Simple ANDed term with Hidden NAND)**: `F = (A.C)' * B`
    - `(A.C)'` is a hidden NAND, requiring 1 NAND gate. Let this output be `P`.
    - Now we need to implement `P * B`.
    - To implement `X * Y` using NANDs, it requires 2 NAND gates (`((X.Y)')'`).
    - So, 1 (for `P`) + 2 (for `P * B`) = **3 NANDs**. This matches the speaker's calculation.

#### 4.2 Functions, SOP, POS, and Operations ⭐❓

- ==**SOP (Sum of Products)**: ==Represents terms for which the **output is '1'**.
    
- ==**POS (Product of Sums)**:== Represents terms for which the **output is '0'**.
    
    - If a function `F(A,B,C)` has `Sum(1,3,4)` in SOP, then its POS form will contain `Product(0,2,5,6,7)`.

- **Complementation**: When taking the complement of a function:
    
    - SOP terms (representing '1's) become terms representing '0's.
    - POS terms (representing '0's) become terms representing '1's.
    - **Example**: If `F = Sum(0,1,7)` then `F' = Sum(2,3,4,5,6)`.

- **Logic Operations Between Functions (SOP based)**:
    
    - Given `F1 = Sum(0,2,4,5,6)` and `F2 = Sum(0,2,4,5,7)`.

    - **F3 = F1 XNOR F2 (SOP)**:
        - XNOR output is '1' when both inputs are the **same** (both '0' or both '1').
        - **Terms present in both F1 and F2 (where both are '1')**: `Sum(0,2,4,5)`
        - **Terms missing from both F1 and F2 (where both are '0')**: Term `3` (since it's not in F1 or F2, means F1(3)=0, F2(3)=0).
        - **Result**: `Sum(0,2,3,4,5)`.

    - **F4 = F1 NOR F2 (SOP)**:
        - NOR output is '1' only when **both inputs are '0'**.
        - **Terms missing from both F1 and F2**: Term `3`.
        - **Result**: `Sum(3)`.

    - **F5 = F1 NAND F2 (SOP)**:
        - NAND output is '1' when **any input is '0' or both are '0'**.
        - **Terms missing from F1 or F2, or both**:
            - `F1(1)=0, F2(1)=0` (1 is missing from both) -> Output 1. So `1` is included.
            - `F1(3)=0, F2(3)=0` (3 is missing from both) -> Output 1. So `3` is included.
            - `F1(6)=1, F2(6)=0` (6 is missing from F2) -> Output 1. So `6` is included.
            - `F1(7)=0, F2(7)=1` (7 is missing from F1) -> Output 1. So `7` is included.
        - **Terms present in both (where both are '1')**: `0,2,4,5` -> Output 0. These are NOT included.
        - **Result**: `Sum(1,3,6,7)`.

- **NAND/NOR Gate Count (2-input)**:
    - To implement a Full Adder: **9 NAND gates** or **9 NOR gates** are required.

#### 5.3 Parallel Adder (Ripple Carry Adder)

![](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/digital-electronics/images/parallel-adder.jpg)

- **Purpose**: Adds two multi-bit binary numbers (e.g., A = A3A2A1A0, B = B3B2B1B0).
- **Construction**: Uses multiple Full Adders, one for each bit position. The Carry_out of one Full Adder becomes the Carry_in for the next most significant bit's Full Adder.
    - The LSB Full Adder's Carry_in is typically '0' if no initial carry is present.
- **Worst Case Delay (for N-bit Adder)**:
    - This is the time taken for the complete addition result to stabilize.
    - **Worst Case Delay = Sum of Carry Delays of first (N-1) Full Adders + Maximum of Sum or Carry Delay of the Nth (MSB) Full Adder**.
    - If all Full Adders have same Sum Delay (Ts) and Carry Delay (Tc):
        - `Worst Case Delay = (N-1) * Tc + Max(Ts, Tc)`.

#### 5.4 Comparator

- **Purpose**: Compares two binary numbers (A and B) and determines if `A > B`, `A < B`, or `A = B`.
    
- **Single-Bit Comparator (A0, B0)**:
    
    - **A0 > B0**: Output '1' only if `A0=1` and `B0=0`. Logical Expression: **`A0 . B0'`**.
    - **A0 < B0**: Output '1' only if `A0=0` and `B0=1`. Logical Expression: **`A0' . B0`**.
    - **A0 = B0**: Output '1' only if `A0=0` and `B0=0`, OR `A0=1` and `B0=1`. Logical Expression: **`A0 XNOR B0`**.
- **Multi-Bit Comparator (e.g., 3-bit: A2A1A0, B2B1B0)**: Comparison starts from the Most Significant Bit (MSB).
    
    - **A > B Logical Expression**:
        - `A2 . B2'` (If MSB of A is greater)
        - `+ (A2 XNOR B2) . A1 . B1'` (If MSBs are equal, check next bit A1 > B1)
        - `+ (A2 XNOR B2) . (A1 XNOR B1) . A0 . B0'` (If first two MSBs are equal, check next bit A0 > B0).
    - **A < B Logical Expression**:
        - `A2' . B2` (If MSB of A is less)
        - `+ (A2 XNOR B2) . A1' . B1` (If MSBs are equal, check next bit A1 < B1)
        - `+ (A2 XNOR B2) . (A1 XNOR B1) . A0' . B0` (If first two MSBs are equal, check next bit A0 < B0).
    - **A = B Logical Expression**:
        - `(A2 XNOR B2) . (A1 XNOR B1) . (A0 XNOR B0)` (All corresponding bits must be equal).

- **Counting Combinations for Comparator Outputs**:
    
    - **Case 1: Both numbers have the SAME number of bits (N bits)**.
        
        - Total combinations of (A, B) = `2^N * 2^N = 2^(2N)`.
        - Number of combinations where **`A = B`**: `2^N` (Since for each of the `2^N` possible values of A, there is exactly one matching value for B).
        - Number of combinations where **`A > B`** (or `A < B`):
            - These are equal when N bits are same.
            - Sum of integers from `0` to `(2^N - 1)`.
            - `Sum(0 to 2^N - 1) = (2^N - 1) * (2^N) / 2`.
        - **Example: N = 4 bits** (A and B are 4-bit numbers)
            - Total combinations = `2^(2*4) = 2^8 = 256`.
            - `A = B` combinations = `2^4 = 16`.
            - `A > B` (or `A < B`) combinations = `(2^4 - 1) * 2^4 / 2 = 15 * 16 / 2 = 120`.
            - **Note**: If an expression `A > B` is written in **SOP form**, it will have **120 minterms**. If in **POS form**, it will have `Total - SOP_minterms = 256 - 120 = 136` maxterms.
    - **Case 2: Numbers have UNEQUAL number of bits (A has N1 bits, B has N2 bits)**. Assume `N1 > N2`.
        
        - Total combinations of (A, B) = `2^N1 * 2^N2 = 2^(N1 + N2)`.
        - Number of combinations where **`A < B`**:
            - This count is usually smaller because `A` has fewer bits.
            - It is the sum of integers from `0` to `(2^N1 - 1)` (if A is smaller, it's `Sum(0 to 2^N2 - 1)`).
            - Formula: `(2^N2 - 1) * 2^N2 / 2` (sum of values `0` to `(2^N2 - 1)`).
        - Number of combinations where **`A = B`**: `2^N2` (total combinations of the number with fewer bits).
        - Number of combinations where **`A > B`**: `Total_combinations - (A < B_count + A = B_count)`.
        - **Example: A (4-bit), B (7-bit)**
            - A (N1=4 bits), B (N2=7 bits). Here N2 > N1. So B is the larger bit number.
            - Total combinations = `2^(4+7) = 2^11 = 2048`.
            - We want to find `A < B`. This will be the higher count, as B has more bits.
            - First, find `B < A` (the smaller count, as A is the smaller bit number). This is the sum of A's values: `(2^4 - 1) * 2^4 / 2 = 15 * 16 / 2 = 120`.
            - `A = B` combinations: `2^4 = 16` (total combinations of A).
            - `A < B` combinations = `Total - (B < A + A = B)`
            - `A < B` = `2048 - (120 + 16) = 2048 - 136 = 1912`.
            - **Result**: 1912 combinations for `A < B`.

### 6. Multiplexers (Mux)

![](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/digital-electronics/images/digital-electronics-multiplexer.jpg)

- **Concept**: A combinational circuit that selects one of `2^N` input lines and routes it to a single output line. The selection is controlled by `N` select lines.
    - It acts like a data selector or a "many-to-one" switch.

#### 6.1 Basic Mux Operation and Expressions

- **2:1 Mux**:
    - Inputs: `I0, I1`. Select Line: `S0`.
    - Output: `Y = S0' . I0 + S0 . I1`.
    - If `S0 = 0`, `Y = I0`. If `S0 = 1`, `Y = I1`.

- **4:1 Mux**:
    - Inputs: `I0, I1, I2, I3`. Select Lines: `S1, S0`.
    - Output: `Y = S1'S0'I0 + S1'S0I1 + S1S0'I2 + S1S0I3`.

#### 6.2 Higher Order Mux using Lower Order Mux

- To implement a `2^N : 1` Mux using `2^M : 1` Mux (where `N > M`):
    - **Method**: Repeatedly divide the number of higher-order Mux inputs by the number of lower-order Mux inputs until the quotient is 1.
    - **Example**: `256:1` Mux using `4:1` Mux:
        - `256 / 4 = 64` (first stage)
        - `64 / 4 = 16` (second stage)
        - `16 / 4 = 4` (third stage)
        - `4 / 4 = 1` (fourth stage, final Mux)
        - Total `4:1` Muxes needed: `64 + 16 + 4 + 1 = 85`.
    - **When Division is Not Exact**:
        - **Example**: `32:1` Mux using `8:1` Mux:
            - `32 / 8 = 4` (first stage)
            - Now we have 4 inputs to select. Since we are using `8:1` Muxes, we need one more `8:1` Mux for the final stage.
            - **Number of `8:1` Muxes**: `4` (for the first stage) + `1` (for the final stage, used as `4:1` Mux) = **5 Muxes**.

#### 6.3 Function Implementation using Mux

- **General Principle**: Select lines are always driven by variables. Inputs to the Mux (I0, I1, etc.) can be 0, 1, or remaining variables/their complements.
    
- **Method 1: Same Order Mux (N-variable function with `2^N:1` Mux)**:
    
    - **Example**: `F(A,B) = Sum(0,2)` using `4:1` Mux.
    - Connect all function variables (A, B) to the select lines (S1=A, S0=B).
    - The Mux inputs (I0, I1, I2, I3) correspond to minterms 0, 1, 2, 3.
    - For minterms present in SOP (`0`, `2`), set corresponding Mux inputs to `1`.
    - For minterms not in SOP (`1`, `3`), set corresponding Mux inputs to `0`.
    - **`I0=1, I1=0, I2=1, I3=0`**.

- **Method 2: Lower Order Mux (N-variable function with `2^(N-1):1` Mux)**:
    
    - **Example**: `F(A,B,C) = Sum(0,1,3,4)` using `4:1` Mux.
    - Connect `N-1` variables (e.g., A, C) to select lines (S1=A, S0=C).
    - The remaining variable (B) will be used for the Mux inputs (I0, I1, I2, I3), along with 0, 1, B, B'.
    - Create a table where columns are Mux inputs (I0 to I3) and rows are combinations of select lines (00, 01, 10, 11).
    - For each Mux input `Ij`, list the minterms from the function `F` that correspond to the select line combination `j` **and** where the remaining variable (B) is 0 (B_bar) or 1 (B).
        - **I0 (AC=00)**: Minterms where AC=00 are 0 (000), 1 (001).
        - **I1 (AC=01)**: Minterms where AC=01 are 2 (010), 3 (011).
        - **I2 (AC=10)**: Minterms where AC=10 are 4 (100), 5 (101).
        - **I3 (AC=11)**: Minterms where AC=11 are 6 (110), 7 (111).
    - Map the function's minterms (`0,1,3,4`) to these locations:
        - `I0`: `F(0)=1` (B=0, i.e., B_bar), `F(1)=1` (B=1, i.e., B). Both are needed. So, `B_bar + B = 1`. **`I0 = 1`**.
        - `I1`: `F(2)=0`, `F(3)=1` (B=1, i.e., B). So, `0 * B_bar + 1 * B = B`. **`I1 = B`**.
        - `I2`: `F(4)=1` (B=0, i.e., B_bar), `F(5)=0`. So, `1 * B_bar + 0 * B = B_bar`. **`I2 = B_bar`**.
        - `I3`: `F(6)=0`, `F(7)=0`. So, `0 * B_bar + 0 * B = 0`. **`I3 = 0`**.
    - **Result**: `I0=1, I1=B, I2=B_bar, I3=0`.

- **Method 3: Even Lower Order Mux (N-variable function with `2^(N-2):1` Mux)**:
    
    - **Example**: `F(A,B,C) = Sum(0,1,3,4)` using `2:1` Mux.
    - Connect `N-2` variables (e.g., A) to select line (S0=A).
    - Remaining variables (B, C) will be used for Mux inputs (I0, I1).
    - Create a table where columns are Mux inputs (I0, I1) and rows are select line combinations (0, 1).
    - For `I0` (A=0), list minterms with A=0: `0 (000), 1 (001), 2 (010), 3 (011)`.
    - For `I1` (A=1), list minterms with A=1: `4 (100), 5 (101), 6 (110), 7 (111)`.
    - Map function minterms (`0,1,3,4`) to these locations and derive the logical expression for `I0` and `I1` in terms of B and C:
        - `I0 (A=0)`: Minterms `0(00)`, `1(01)`, `2(10)`, `3(11)` in (B,C) order.
            - `F(0)=1` (BC=00), `F(1)=1` (BC=01), `F(2)=0`, `F(3)=1` (BC=11).
            - So `I0` needs to be `BC=00` and `BC=01` and `BC=11`.
            - `I0 = B'C' + B'C + BC`.
            - `I0 = B'(C' + C) + BC = B' + BC = (B'+B)(B'+C) = B'+C`.
            - **`I0 = B' + C`**.
        - `I1 (A=1)`: Minterms `4(00)`, `5(01)`, `6(10)`, `7(11)` in (B,C) order.
            - `F(4)=1` (BC=00), `F(5)=0`, `F(6)=0`, `F(7)=0`.
            - So `I1` needs to be `BC=00`.
            - **`I1 = B'C'`**.
- **Shortcut for Function Implementation (Direct Substitution)**:
    
    - **Example**: `F(A,B,C) = A' + B + B.C + B'.C` to be implemented using `2:1` Mux with `A` as select line.
    - **For I0**: Set `A = 0` in the function `F`.
        - `F(0,B,C) = 0' + B + B.C + B'.C`
        - `= 1 + B + B.C + B'.C`
        - `= 1` (since `1 + Anything = 1`)
        - **`I0 = 1`**.
    - **For I1**: Set `A = 1` in the function `F`.
        - `F(1,B,C) = 1' + B + B.C + B'.C`
        - `= 0 + B + B.C + B'.C`
        - `= B + B.C + B'.C`
        - `= B(1+C) + B'.C`
        - `= B + B'.C`
        - `= (B+B')(B+C)` (using OR over AND distributive law)
        - `= 1 . (B+C)`
        - **`I1 = B + C`**.
    - **Example (from video)**: `F(A,B,C) = A' + B + B.C + B'.C` implemented using `2:1` Mux with `A` as select line (speaker's actual example during explanation was `A_bar + B.C + B_bar.C` with B as select line, he wrote `A_bar + B + B_bar + C` then corrected it).
        - Using the example `A_bar + B + B.C + B_bar.C` (as derived from video).
        - **F(A,B,C) = A' + B + C** (since `B + BC + B'C = B + C`)
        - With `A` as select line:
            - **`I0` (for `A=0`)**: `0' + B + C = 1 + B + C = 1`.
            - **`I1` (for `A=1`)**: `1' + B + C = 0 + B + C = B + C`.
        - The actual problem given was `A_bar + B + B_bar + C` which then simplify as `A_bar + 1 + C = 1`. So, `F = 1`. If so, then `I0 = 1` and `I1 = 1`.
        - However, the speaker's worked example for `A_bar + B_bar + B + B_bar + C` was used for `I0` calculation which was `B_bar + C` and `I1` was `BC`. This suggests the function was different or a typo.
        - Let's use the function `F(A,B,C) = A_bar + B.C + B_bar.C` for his final calculation:
        - `F = A_bar + C(B + B_bar) = A_bar + C`.
        - If `A` is select line:
            - **`I0` (for `A=0`)**: `0_bar + C = 1 + C = 1`.
            - **`I1` (for `A=1`)**: `1_bar + C = 0 + C = C`.
        - This does not match `B_bar + C` and `BC`. This highlights that the speaker might have had a different example in mind when demonstrating, or a typo in the on-screen calculation.
        - **Let's use the provided problem statement** in the prompt: `F(A,B,C) = A_bar + B + B_bar + C`.
            - Simplify this first: `A_bar + (B + B_bar) + C = A_bar + 1 + C = 1`.
            - So, `F(A,B,C) = 1`.
            - If `A` is the select line:
                - `I0` (when A=0): `F(0,B,C) = 1`. So `I0 = 1`.
                - `I1` (when A=1): `F(1,B,C) = 1`. So `I1 = 1`.
            - This is the simplest. The speaker's on-screen solution for `A_bar + B + B_bar + C` was `B_bar + C` for `I0` and `BC` for `I1`, which is not consistent with `F=1`. The actual example worked for `B_bar+C` and `BC` as inputs was `(A+B+C') * (A+B'+C)` simplified earlier to `A + BC` (where A was select line). **There seems to be a mismatch between the stated function and the derived inputs in the video example at.** I will stick to the method.

#### 6.4 Special Mux Implementations (2:1 Mux)

![](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/digital-electronics/images/2-to-1-multiplexer.jpg)

- ==**XOR Gate Implementation**:== Using a 2:1 Mux, ==if `I0` and `I1` are **complements== of each other** (e.g., `B` and `B'`), the output will be an XOR operation with the select line.
    - `Y = S0' . B + S0 . B'` (If `I0=B, I1=B'` with `S0` as select line)
    - **Result: `Y = S0 XOR B'`** (if `I0=B`, `I1=B`').
    - **Result: `Y = S0 XOR B`** (if `I0=B'`, `I1=B`).

- **XNOR Gate Implementation**: Using a 2:1 Mux, if `I0` and `I1` are **the same** (e.g., `B` and `B`), the output will be an XNOR operation with the select line.
    - `Y = S0' . B + S0 . B` (If `I0=B, I1=B` with `S0` as select line)
    - **Result: `Y = S0 XNOR B`**.

### 7. K-Map Simplification and Implicants

#### 7.1 K-Map Simplification Rules

- ==**Objective**:== Find the minimum SOP or POS expression.
    
- **Strategy**:
    
    1. Concentrate on an **unused '1'** (minterm) in the K-Map.
    2. Form the **largest possible group** (Octet, Quad, Pair) that includes this '1'. Used '1's, Don't Cares, and other unused '1's can be used to form the largest group.
    3. Once a '1' is covered, do not focus on it again unless it helps form a larger group for another unused '1'.
    4. Repeat until all '1's are covered.
    5. **Output Expression**: Only include **non-redundant groups** in the final minimized expression.
        - **Non-Redundant Group**: A group that contains at least one '1' (minterm) that is **not covered by any other group** in the final set of selected groups.
        - **Redundant Group**: A group where all its '1's (minterms) are **already covered by other non-redundant groups**. These are not included in the final expression.

- **Example 1 (3-variable)**:    
    - K-Map:
        ```
        AB\C  0  1
        00    1  0
        01    0  0
        11    0  0
        10    1  0
        ```
    - This represents `Sum(0, 4)`.
    - **Groups**:
        - `A'B'` (from minterm 0)
        - `AB` (from minterm 4, should be `A B'` for minterm 4).
    - Let's assume the K-Map given was `Sum(0,3)` for `F(A,B,C)`:
        
        ```
        AB\C  0  1
        00    1  0
        01    0  1
        11    0  0
        10    0  0
        ```
        - This gives `A'B'C'` (minterm 0) and `A'BC` (minterm 3).
        - The example shown in the video for `A'B' + AB` as a simplification for a 2-variable K-Map.
        - **Correct K-Map for `A'B' + AB` (2-variable)**:
            
            ```
            A\B 0  1
            0   1  0  (A'B' = 1, A'B = 0)
            1   0  1  (AB' = 0, AB = 1)
            ```
            
            - This is `A XNOR B`. So, `A'B' + AB`.
            - **Groups**:
                - Pair `A'B'` (minterm 0).
                - Pair `AB` (minterm 3).
            - Both are non-redundant. Result: `A'B' + AB`.
- **Example 2 (3-variable with Don't Cares)**:
    
    - K-Map:
        
        ```
        AB\C  0  1
        00    0  0
        01    1  X  (X is don't care)
        11    0  0
        10    0  1
        ```
        
    - Assuming minterms `Sum(3, 5)` and don't care `X(7)` for `F(A,B,C)`.
        
        ```
        AB\C  0  1
        00    0  1  (minterm 1)
        01    1  0  (minterm 2)
        11    X  0  (minterm 6)
        10    0  1  (minterm 5)
        ```
        
        - Speaker's drawing at
            
            ```
            AB\C  0  1
            00    0  1  (minterm 1)
            01    1  X  (minterm 3, don't care at 7)
            11    X  1  (minterm 7, minterm 6)
            10    0  0
            ```
            
            - This mapping is inconsistent with the provided example `A' + C`.
            - Let's use the K-map from the video with 1s at `m(2), m(5)` and Don't Cares at `X(3), X(7)`:
            
            ```
            AB\C  0  1
            00    0  0
            01    1  X (m2, m3)
            11    X  1 (m7, m6)
            10    0  0
            ```
            
            - This is still not `A' + C`. The speaker stated the result was `A' + C`. `A' + C` corresponds to `Sum(0,1,2,3,5,7)`.
            - Let's assume the K-Map to be simplified was `Sum(0,1,2,3,5,7)` with no don't cares.
            - `A'` covers `Sum(0,1,2,3)`. `C` covers `Sum(1,3,5,7)`.
            - **Groups**:
                - Quad `A'` (covers `m(0,1,2,3)`).
                - Quad `C` (covers `m(1,3,5,7)`).
            - Both are non-redundant. `A' + C`.
- **Example 3 (4-variable)**:
    
    - K-Map:
        
        ```
        CD\AB    00 01 11 10

        - Minterms `Sum(5, 7, 13)`

            ```
            
            - Let's use the K-map with `1`s at `m(5), m(6), m(7), m(13), m(14)` from the verbal description, and don't care `X(15)`.
            - K-Map (based on actual verbal process): `Sum(5, 6, 7, 13, 14)` and don't care `X(15)`.
            
            ```

            ```
            
            - **Let's rely on the speaker's final simplified map result from: `B'D + A'BC'`**
            
            ```

            ```
            
            - This is not for the simplified expression. Let's trace the actual K-map from.
                
                - 1s at: `m(5), m(7), m(6), m(13), m(14)`. Don't Cares at `m(11), m(15)`.

                ```
                
                - **Groups formed**:
                    - Quad 1 (Green): `m(5),m(7),m(13),m(15)` - Using wrapping. Value: **`BD`** (B for column 01 and 11, D for row 01 and 11).
                    - Quad 2 (Pink): `m(6),m(7),m(14),m(15)` - Using wrapping. Value: **`BC`** (B for column 01 and 11, C for row 01 and 11).
                    - Pair (Blue): `m(14), m(15)` - Value: **`AC`**.
                - In the video, speaker said they found `B'D` and `A'BC'`
                    - `B'D`: covers `m(1,3,9,11)`
                    - `A'BC'`: covers `m(4,5)`
                - The problem drawn was different from the solution. Let's use the result `B'D + A'BC'` for the given K-Map (which is _not_ the one drawn exactly but was mentioned in the audio).
                - **Result**: `B'D + A'BC'`.
                - The speaker then drew a different K-map and formed these groups leading to `B'D + A'BC'`.

                    - **Groups**:
                        - Quad `B'D` (covers `m(5,7,13,15)`).
                        - Pair `A'BC'` (covers `m(4)` and if there was a `m(0)` it would be `A'B'C'`).
                    - This example had some confusion in explanation.
- **Example from**:
    
    - K-Map:
        
        ```
        CD\AB   00 01 11 10
        00       1  0  0  0   (m0)
        01       0  1  1  0   (m5, m7)
        11       0  1  1  0   (m11, m15)
        10       0  0  0  1   (m12)
        ```
        
    - **Groups**:
        - Quad `CD` (wraps `m(5,7,13,15)` in 4-variable K-map).
        - Quad `A'B` (covers `m(4,5,6,7)` but here `m(4,5,6,7)` are not all 1s).
        - The speaker formed 3 quads:
            - Quad 1: `m(0,4,8,12)` (column 00 and 10, row 00 and 10) => `B'D'` (if m0,m4,m12,m8 are 1)
            - Quad 2: `m(5,7,13,15)` (column 01 and 11, row 01 and 11) => `BD` (if m5,m7,m13,m15 are 1)
            - Quad 3: `m(6,7,14,15)` (column 01 and 11, row 10 and 11) => `BC` (if m6,m7,m14,m15 are 1)
        - **Final Result**: `A'B + CD + BC`. (Assuming this was the correct input for the three quads).
- **Example from**:
    
    - K-Map:
        
        ```
        CD\AB   00 01 11 10
        00       0  X  0  X
        01       0  1  0  X
        11       0  0  0  0
        10       1  X  X  X
        ```
        
    - **Groups formed**:
        - Quad 1 (corner): `m(0,2,8,10)` => `B'D'` (if 1s at m0,m2,m8,m10, and using don't cares). Speaker formed corner quad of four 1s.
        - Quad 2: `m(4,5,6,7)` => `A'B` (if 1s at m4,m5,m6,m7). Speaker formed `A'D`.
        - The speaker then formed two non-redundant quads:
            - Quad 1 (Corner Quad): If 1s are at `m(0,2,8,10)` along with don't cares. Value: `B'D'`.
            - Quad 2 (Edge Quad): If 1s are at `m(4,6,12,14)` or `m(1,3,9,11)` along with don't cares. Speaker said `A'D`.
        - **Final Result (from speaker)**: **`B'D' + A'D`**.

#### 7.2 Implicants, Prime Implicants (PI), and Essential Prime Implicants (EPI)

- **Implicant**: Any rectangle (group of 1s or 1s with Don't Cares) in a K-Map.
    
- **Prime Implicant (PI)**: An implicant that **cannot be combined with any other term or group to form a larger implicant** (group).
    
    - This means it's the largest possible rectangle for the 1s it contains.
    - It doesn't matter if it's redundant or non-redundant, just if it can be further combined.
- **Essential Prime Implicant (EPI)**: A Prime Implicant that covers at least one '1' (minterm) that **no other Prime Implicant can cover**.
    
    - These PIs **must** be included in the final minimized expression.
- **Non-Essential Prime Implicant (Non-EPI)**: A Prime Implicant whose all '1's (minterms) are **already covered by other Prime Implicants**.
    
    - These PIs are optional in the final expression; they are chosen only if needed to cover remaining 1s in a minimal way.
- **Finding PI and EPI**:
    
    1. **Identify all PIs**: Form all possible largest rectangular groups of '1's (and don't cares). This includes groups that might overlap heavily or seem redundant in the final solution. All such groups that cannot be enlarged are PIs.
    2. **Identify EPIs**: For each PI, check its '1's. If any '1' within that PI is _only_ covered by that specific PI (and no other PI), then that PI is an EPI.
    3. **Identify Non-EPIs**: Any PI that is not an EPI is a Non-EPI. All of its '1's are covered by other PIs.
    4. **Final Minimized Expression**: Include all EPIs. Then, cover any remaining uncovered '1's using the minimum number of Non-EPIs.
- **Example (from video)**: K-Map for `F(A,B,C) = Sum(0,1,3,4)`
    
    ```
    AB\C  0  1
    00    1  1   (m0, m1)
    01    0  1   (m3)
    11    0  0
    10    1  0   (m4)
    ```
    
    - **All PIs**:
        1. Pair `m(0,1)`: `A'B'` (covers 1s at m0, m1). Cannot be made larger. This is a PI.
        2. Pair `m(1,3)`: `A'C` (covers 1s at m1, m3). Cannot be made larger. This is a PI.
        3. Pair `m(0,4)`: `B'C'` (covers 1s at m0, m4). Cannot be made larger. This is a PI.
        4. Isolated `m(4)`: If `m(4)` was alone, it would be `AB'C'`.
    - The speaker identified 3 PIs: `A'B'`, `A'C`, `B'C'`. (Assuming the actual 1s were located such that these PIs were formed).
    - **Identifying EPIs**:
        - **`A'B'` (PI 1)**: Covers `m0` and `m1`. `m0` is only covered by `A'B'`. No other PI covers `m0`. So, `A'B'` is an **EPI**.
        - **`A'C` (PI 2)**: Covers `m1` and `m3`. `m1` is also covered by `A'B'`. `m3` is only covered by `A'C`. So, `A'C` is an **EPI**.
        - **`B'C'` (PI 3)**: Covers `m0` and `m4`. `m0` is also covered by `A'B'`. `m4` is only covered by `B'C'`. So, `B'C'` is an **EPI**.
    - In this specific setup by the speaker where 3 PIs are derived from the minimal covers for m0, m1, m3, m4, all 3 PIs become EPIs.
- **Example 2 (More Complex EPI/Non-EPI)**:
    
    - K-Map from (with 1s at `m(0,1,3,4,5,7)`):
        
        ```
        AB\C  0  1
        00    1  1  (m0, m1)
        01    0  1  (m3)
        11    0  1  (m7)  <-- Should be m6, m7 are 110, 111. So 11 line has no 1. Let's use 1s from the solution path.
        10    1  1  (m4, m5)
        ```
        
        - **K-Map from solution discussion**:
            
            ```
            AB\C  0  1
            00    1  1  (m0, m1)
            01    X  1  (m3, X at m2)
            11    1  1  (m6, m7)
            10    1  X  (m4, X at m5)
            ```
            
            - Let's use the explicit example from given for EPI/non-EPI:
                
                - 1s at `m(0,1,3,4,5,7)` (from `A'B'+AB+CD+BC`). No this is result.
                - Speaker says PIs are `A'B'`, `AB`, `A'C`, `BC`.
                - Let's assume the K-map from the video was: `m(0,1,3,4,5,6,7)`
                
                ```
                AB\C  0  1
                00    1  1
                01    1  1
                11    1  1
                10    1  1
                ```
                
                - This is `1`. This is not it.
                - Let's take the provided PIs and check for Essentiality from the video:
                    - `A'B'` (Covers `m0, m1`): `m0` only covered by `A'B'`. So `A'B'` is an **EPI**.
                    - `AB` (Covers `m2, m3` or `m6, m7`): `m(6,7)` (from a specific example used verbally). `m6` is only covered by `AB`. So `AB` is an **EPI**.
                    - `A'C` (Covers `m1, m3`): `m1` also by `A'B'`. `m3` also by `BC`. So `A'C` is a **Non-EPI**.
                    - `BC` (Covers `m3, m7`): `m3` also by `A'C`. `m7` also by `AB`. So `BC` is a **Non-EPI**.
                - **Result**: Two EPIs (`A'B'`, `AB`) and two Non-EPIs (`A'C`, `BC`).
                - The final minimized expression would be `A'B' + AB` and then one of `A'C` or `BC` to cover remaining minterms (if any) that are not covered by EPIs. (This example showed that K-map solution only chooses non-redundant, not necessarily EPIs first, then other non-redundant).

### 8. Sequential Circuits - Latches and Flip-Flops

#### 8.1 Introduction to Sequential Circuits

- **Definition**: Output depends on **present inputs AND past output values (memory)**.
- **Next Output (Q_next)**: Function of `Present Input` and `Present Output (Q)`.
    - `Q_next = f(Present_Input, Q)`

#### 8.2 SR Latch (NAND Gate Based)

- **Inputs**: S (Set), R (Reset).
- **Outputs**: Q (Normal output), Q_bar (Complementary output).
- **Output definition**: `Q` is the upper output, `Q_bar` is the lower output.
- **Truth Table (S, R -> Q_next)**:

| S   | R   | Q_next | Q̅_next | State       |
| --- | --- | ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| 0   | 0   | 1      | 1       | **Invalid** |
| 0   | 1   | 1      | 0       | **Set**     |
| 1   | 0   | 0      | 1       | **Reset**   |
| 1   | 1   | Q      | Q̅      | **Hold**    |

#### 8.3 SR Latch (NOR Gate Based)

- **Inputs**: S (Set), R (Reset).
- **Outputs**: Q (Normal output), Q_bar (Complementary output).
- **Output definition**: `Q` is the lower output, `Q_bar` is the upper output.
- **Truth Table (S, R -> Q_next)**

| S   | R   | Q_next | Q̅_next | State   |
| --- | --- | ------ | ------- | ------- |
| 0   | 0   | Q      | Q̅      | Hold    |

| 1   | 1   | 0      | 0       | Invalid |
#### 8.4 SR Flip-Flop (Clocked)

- **Construction**: An SR Latch with additional gates at the input controlled by a clock signal.
    
- **Triggering**:
    
    - **Level Triggered**: Output changes when the clock is at a specific logic level (High or Low).
        - **Positive Level Triggered**: Triggered when **Clock = 1**. Inputs S, R are active.
        - **Negative Level Triggered**: Triggered when **Clock = 0**. Inputs S, R are active.
    - **Edge Triggered**: Output changes only during a specific transition of the clock signal (rising edge: 0 to 1, or falling edge: 1 to 0). Modern FFs are typically edge-triggered.
    - When the clock is NOT triggering, the output holds its current state.

- **Truth Table (S, R -> Q_next, when Clock is Triggered)**:
    
    - This is the same as the NOR Latch truth table. 

|S|R|Q_next|State|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|0|Q|Hold|
|0|1|0|Reset|
|1|0|1|Set|
|1|1|Invalid|Invalid
    
- **Characteristic Equation**:
    - **`Q_next = S + R'Q`**.
    - **Validity**: This equation is **only valid when `S . R = 0`** (i.e., when S and R are not both 1).

- **Excitation Table (Q, Q_next → S, R)**:  
    Shows the required S and R inputs to achieve a desired state transition.

| Q   | Q_next | S   | R   |
| --- | ------ | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0      | 0   | X   |
| 0   | 1      | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0      | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1      | X   | 0   |

(X = Don't Care)

#### 8.5 JK Flip-Flop

- **Purpose**: Designed to **overcome the invalid state (11)** problem of the SR Flip-Flop.
    
- **Truth Table (`J, K -> Q_next`, when Clock is Triggered)**: 

| J   | K   | Q_next | State      |
| --- | --- | ------ | ---------- |
| 0   | 0   | Q      | Hold       |
| 0   | 1   | 0      | Reset      |
| 1   | 0   | 1      | Set        |
| 1   | 1   | Q'     | **Toggle** |
(Output complements its present state)


- **Characteristic Table (`J, K, Q -> Q_next`)**: 

| J   | K   | Q   | Q_next | Description    |
| --- | --- | --- | ------ | -------------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0      | Hold           |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 1      | Hold           |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 0      | Reset          |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0      | Reset          |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1      | Set            |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 1      | Set            |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1      | Toggle (0 → 1) |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 0      | Toggle (1 → 0) |
    
- **Characteristic Equation**:
    - **`Q_next = JQ' + K'Q`**.
    - **Validity**: This equation is **ALWAYS VALID** (no invalid states, unlike SR).

- **Excitation Table (`Q, Q_next -> J, K`)**: 
 
| Q   | Q_next | J   | K   |
| --- | ------ | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0      | 0   | X   |
| 0   | 1      | 1   | X   |
| 1   | 0      | X   | 1   |
| 1   | 1      | X   | 0   |
    

#### 8.6 Race Around Condition

- **Definition**: Occurs when the output of a flip-flop toggles multiple times within a single clock pulse, leading to an unpredictable final state.
- **Conditions for Race Around (all must be met)**:
    1. The flip-flop must be a **JK Flip-Flop**.
    2. The flip-flop must be **Level Triggered**. (Not edge-triggered)
    3. The inputs must be **J=1 and K=1** (Toggle mode).
    4. The **Pulse Width** of the clock signal must be **much greater than the propagation delay of the flip-flop**.
- **Avoidance Methods**:
    1. **Using Edge-Triggered JK Flip-Flops**: This is the most common and preferred solution today. Edge triggering ensures the flip-flop is active only for a very short duration during the clock transition, making the pulse width effectively smaller than the flip-flop delay.
    2. **Using Master-Slave JK Flip-Flops**: This older technique uses two level-triggered JK flip-flops (Master and Slave).
        - When the Master is active (e.g., clock HIGH), the Slave is inactive.
        - When the Slave is active (e.g., clock LOW), the Master is inactive.
        - Data is transferred from Master to Slave only when the clock transitions (e.g., HIGH to LOW).
        - This structure effectively makes the overall Master-Slave flip-flop behave like an edge-triggered flip-flop, ensuring the output changes only once per clock cycle.

#### 8.7 D Flip-Flop

- **Names**: Delay Flip-Flop, Data Flip-Flop, Transparent Latch (when unclocked).
- **Purpose**: Primarily used for data transfer and storing a single bit.
- **Truth Table (`D -> Q_next`, when Clock is Triggered)**: 

| D   | Q_next | State |
| --- | ------ | ----- |
| 0   | 0      | Reset |
| 1   | 1      | Set   |

- **Characteristic Equation**:
    - **`Q_next = D`**.
    - The next state is simply whatever data is present at the D input when clocked, regardless of the current state.

- **Excitation Table (`Q, Q_next -> D`)**:
    - **Logic**: Whatever you want `Q_next` to be, `D` must be that value. 

| Q   | Q_next | D   |
| --- | ------ | --- |
| 0   | 0      | 0   |
| 0   | 1      | 1   |
| 1   | 0      | 0   |
| 1   | 1      | 1   |

#### 8.8 T Flip-Flop

- **Name**: Toggle Flip-Flop
- **Purpose**: Used for frequency division and counting applications
- **Truth Table (T → Q_next, on Clock Trigger)**:  

| T   | Q_next | State  |
| --- | ------ | ------ |
| 0   | Q      | Hold   |
| 1   | Q'     | Toggle |

- **Characteristic Equation**:  `Q_next = T ⊕ Q`
- **Excitation Table (Q, Q_next → T)**:  `T = Q ⊕ Q_next`  

| Q | Q_next | T |  
|---|--------|---|  
| 0 | 0 | 0 |  
| 0 | 1 | 1 |  
| 1 | 0 | 1 |  
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

### 9. Counters

#### 9.1 Asynchronous (Ripple) Counter

- **Characteristics**:
    
    - **All flip-flops must operate in Toggle Mode** (e.g., J=K=1 for JK FFs, T=1 for T FFs).
    - **Only one flip-flop (the LSB) is driven by the external clock directly**. The clock input for subsequent flip-flops comes from the output of the previous flip-flop.
    - The LSB flip-flop is the one whose clock input is directly connected to the external clock.
- **Up/Down Counter Determination**: (Based on speaker's specific interpretation using bubbles/non-bubbles on clock inputs derived from Q or Q_bar)
    
    - **Up Counter**: If a non-inverted output (Q) from the previous FF drives the clock input of the next FF, and it's positive edge-triggered (or similar combination that increments count). (Speaker's example implies Q to next clock for Up, Q_bar for Down if using positive edge triggered FFs).
    - **Down Counter**: If an inverted output (Q_bar) from the previous FF drives the clock input of the next FF, and it's positive edge-triggered (or similar combination that decrements count).
- **Mod Number**:
    
    - If **no Clear or Preset pins are used**: The Mod Number is always **`2^N`**, where `N` is the number of flip-flops used.
    - **Frequency Division**: Each flip-flop divides its input clock frequency by 2 at its output. The output of the MSB flip-flop will have a frequency of `F_clk / 2^N` (which is `F_clk / Mod`).
- **Mod Number (other than `2^N`)**:
    
    - Achieved by using **Clear or Preset pins** to force the counter to reset to `0` (or preset to a specific state) before reaching its maximum `2^N` count.
    - **Example**: A 4-bit Up Counter (Mod 16 normally) configured to reset using a NAND gate connected to Clear pins when the state becomes `1011` (decimal 11).
        - The counter counts from `0000` (`0`) up to `1010` (`10`).
        - When it tries to go to `1011` (`11`), the NAND gate's inputs become `Q3=1, Q2=0, Q1=1, Q0=1`. If NAND input is `Q3.Q2_bar.Q1.Q0`, then output would be `1.1.1.1 = 1`, which means Clear bar becomes 1. If Clear bar is low enable then it won't clear.
        - If the NAND input is connected as `(Q3 . Q2_bar . Q1 . Q0)` and output goes to `Clear_bar`. When `Q3=1, Q2_bar=1 (Q2=0), Q1=1, Q0=1`, the NAND output is `0`. If Clear is active low, this will reset the counter to `0000`.
        - The state `1011` (11) is momentarily entered but immediately cleared. It is **not counted as a stable state**.
        - The stable states are `0, 1, 2, ..., 10`.
        - **Mod Number = 11** (11 different stable states: 0 to 10).
        - In this case, frequency division at the output won't be a simple `F_clk / 2^N`. The output frequency will be `F_clk / Mod Number` (e.g., `F_clk / 11`) at some output.
- **Maximum Clock Frequency for Proper Operation**:
    
    - For an N-stage Asynchronous Counter with flip-flop propagation delay `T_DF` (delay from clock edge to output stabilization):
    - `F_clk <= 1 / (N * T_DF)`.
    - **Max `F_clk = 1 / (N * T_DF)`**.
- **Determining Output Frequency without Waveform/Diagram**:
    
    - Observe the sequence of states for each flip-flop's output (Q).
    - Identify the **repeating pattern** for each Q.
    - Count the total number of clock cycles for one complete repetition cycle. This is the **period of that output**.
    - `Frequency = F_clk / (Period_in_cycles)`.
    - **Example 1**: Counter sequence `0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7` (Mod 6 counter).
        - `Q2` (MSB): Sequence is `0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1`. It repeats `000111`. Period is 6 clock cycles. `F_Q2 = F_clk / 6`. (This is a proper square wave).
        - `Q1`: Sequence is `0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1`. It repeats `001011`. Period is 6 clock cycles. `F_Q1 = F_clk / 6`. (This is a broken/non-uniform square wave, not suitable for clocking).
        - `Q0` (LSB): Sequence is `0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1`. It repeats `011001`. Period is 6 clock cycles. `F_Q0 = F_clk / 6`. (Broken square wave).
    - **Example 2**: Counter sequence `0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> 14` (Mod 8 counter).
        - `Q3`: Sequence `0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1`. Repeats. Period 8. `F_Q3 = F_clk / 8`. (Proper square wave).
        - `Q2`: Sequence `0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1`. Repeats. Period 4. `F_Q2 = F_clk / 4`. (Proper square wave).
        - `Q1`: Sequence `0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1`. Repeats. Period 2. `F_Q1 = F_clk / 2`. (Proper square wave).
        - `Q0`: Sequence `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`. Always 0. `F_Q0 = 0` (DC).
        - **Note**: In this example, Q0 being 0 is not consistent with an UP counter normally. Typically Q0 (LSB) changes fastest. This is an example of an arbitrary sequence using a synchronous counter.
- **Determining Mod Number and Number of Flip-Flops for Arbitrary Sequences**:
    
    - **Mod Number**: Count the number of **distinct states** in the counting sequence.
        - If the same number (e.g., '0') appears multiple times, but its **next state (or previous state)** is different each time, then they are **distinct states**. Always assume states are distinct unless explicitly shown to be the same.
    - **Number of Flip-Flops (N)**: Determine the minimum number of bits required to represent the **highest numerical value** in the counting sequence. `N` flip-flops can represent values up to `(2^N - 1)`.
    - **Example 1**: Sequence `0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 16 -> 32 -> 64`.
        - **Mod Number**: 7 (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 are all distinct states).
        - **Number of FFs**: Highest value is 64.
            - 6 bits can represent up to `2^6 - 1 = 63`. Not enough for 64.
            - 7 bits can represent up to `2^7 - 1 = 127`. Enough for 64.
            - Therefore, **7 Flip-Flops** are required.
    - **Example 2**: Sequence `0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 0 -> 3 -> 0 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3`.
        - **Mod Number**: Count all states as distinct (unless pattern and next/prev states explicitly show they are the same).
            - `0_A -> 1_A -> 0_B -> 2_A -> 0_C -> 3_A -> 0_D -> 4_A -> 1_B -> 2_B -> 3_B`
            - `0_A` (next 1_A)
            - `1_A` (next 0_B)
            - `0_B` (next 2_A)
            - `2_A` (next 0_C)
            - `0_C` (next 3_A)
            - `3_A` (next 0_D)
            - `0_D` (next 4_A)
            - `4_A` (next 1_B)
            - `1_B` (next 2_B)
            - `2_B` (next 3_B)
            - `3_B` (next 0_A) - This completes the cycle.
            - All 0s (0_A, 0_B, 0_C, 0_D) are distinct. All 1s (1_A, 1_B) are distinct. All 2s (2_A, 2_B) are distinct. All 3s (3_A, 3_B) are distinct. 4_A is distinct.
            - Total distinct states: 4 (0s) + 2 (1s) + 2 (2s) + 2 (3s) + 1 (4) = **11 states**. So, **Mod Number = 11**.

#### 9.2 Synchronous Counter

- **Characteristics**:
    - **All flip-flops are driven by the same external clock signal**.
    - Unlike asynchronous, **Mod Number can be any value** (even less than `2^N`) **without using Clear/Preset pins**.
    - Any desired **counting sequence is possible** to design using synchronous counters.

#### 9.3 Ring Counter

- **Construction**: Uses D flip-flops cascaded, where the **output of the last flip-flop is fed back to the input of the first flip-flop**.
- **Next State Logic**: For an N-bit Ring Counter, to get the next state from the current state `Q_N-1 ... Q_1 Q_0`:
    - Shift the bits to the right by one position: `0 Q_N-1 ... Q_1`.
    - The `Q_0` (LSB) bit (which is shifted out) becomes the new `Q_N-1` (MSB) bit.
    - So, `Q_next = Q_0 Q_N-1 ... Q_1`.
- **Original Ring Counter**:
    - **Identification**: The starting state has **exactly one '1' bit, and all other bits are '0'** (e.g., `1000`, `0100`, `0010`, `0001` for a 4-bit counter).
    - **Mod Number**: **`N`** (for an N-bit Ring Counter).
    - **Frequency Division**: **All output flip-flops** will have their frequency divided by `N` (i.e., `F_clk / N`).
- **Non-Original Ring Counter**:
    - **Identification**: Any starting state that is **not an original ring counter state** (e.g., `1100`, `1010`).
    - **Mod Number**: Not guaranteed to be `N`. Must generate all states to find the mod number.
    - **Frequency Division**: Not guaranteed to be `F_clk / N` for all outputs. Must calculate based on the sequence.

#### 9.4 Johnson Counter (Twisted Ring Counter)

- **Construction**: Similar to Ring Counter, but the **complement of the output of the last flip-flop (`Q_0_bar`) is fed back to the input of the first flip-flop**.
- **Next State Logic**: For an N-bit Johnson Counter, to get the next state from `Q_N-1 ... Q_1 Q_0`:
    - Shift the bits to the right by one position: `0 Q_N-1 ... Q_1`.
    - The **complement of `Q_0` (`Q_0_bar`)** becomes the new `Q_N-1` (MSB) bit.
- **Original Johnson Counter**:
    - **Identification**: The starting state has **all '1's grouped consecutively and all '0's grouped consecutively**. This means it forms a string of `N` zeros followed by `N` ones (e.g., `000111`, `111000` for 6-bit).
    - **Mod Number**: **`2N`** (for an N-bit Johnson Counter).
    - **Frequency Division**: **All output flip-flops** will have their frequency divided by `2N` (i.e., `F_clk / 2N`).
- **Non-Original Johnson Counter**:
    - **Identification**: Any starting state that is **not an original Johnson counter state** (e.g., `1010`, `0101`).
    - **Mod Number**: Not guaranteed to be `2N`. Must generate all states to find the mod number.
    - **Frequency Division**: Not guaranteed to be `F_clk / 2N` for all outputs. Must calculate based on the sequence.
