# Operating System

> Made from the PDF Notes

## Introduction

##### **What is an Operating System**

A program that acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware.

**Goals of Operating System:**
- Execute user programs and make solving user problems easier
- Make the computer system convenient to use
- Use the computer hardware in an efficient manner
## Computer System Structure

**Four components of a Computer System:**
1. **Hardware** – Provides basic computing resources
2. ==**Operating System** – Controls and coordinates use of hardware among various applications and users
3. **Application Programs** – Define how system resources are used to solve user problems
4. **Users**

##### **What Operating Systems Do**

Depends on the point of view:
- Users want convenience, ease of use, and good performance
- Shared computers (mainframe/minicomputers) must serve multiple users effectively
- Workstations have dedicated resources but often share others via servers
- Handheld systems prioritize usability and battery life due to limited resources
- Embedded systems may have no user interface but require reliable OS for operation

##### **Operating System Definition**

- ==**OS as a Resource Allocator:**
    - Manages all hardware and software resources
    - Handles conflicting requests to ensure fair and efficient use
- ==**OS as a Control Program:**
    - Controls program execution
    - Prevents errors and improper operations

**No Universally Accepted Definition**
**Approximations:**
- **Vendor's View:**  
    "Everything a vendor ships as an OS" – practical but varies

**Core Component:**
- ==**Kernel:**
    - Always running
    - Manages hardware, memory, CPU, and I/O operations
**Other Components:**
- ==**System Programs:**
    - Support system operations
    - Ship with the OS
- ==**Application Programs:**
    - Solve specific user tasks        
    - Run on top of system programs and kernel


##### **Computer Startup**
**Bootstrap Program:**
- Loaded at power-up or reboot
- Stored in ROM/EPROM (**firmware**)
- Initializes system and loads OS kernel

##### **Computer System Organization**
- One or more CPUs and device controllers share a common bus
- Shared memory is accessed by all    
- CPUs and devices run concurrently and compete for memory access

##### **Computer-System Operation**
- ==I/O devices and CPU execute concurrently
- Each device controller manages a specific device
- Each has a local buffer
- CPU transfers data between main memory and local buffers
- I/O happens between device and controller buffer
- Devices signal completion via **interrupts**

##### **Common Functions of Interrupts**
- Interrupt control transfers to the **interrupt service routine** via an **interrupt vector**
- Interrupt vector stores addresses of service routines
- System saves address of the interrupted instruction
- ==A **trap**/**exception** is a software-generated interrupt (error/user request)
- OS is **interrupt-driven**
    
##### **Interrupt Handling**
- ==OS preserves CPU state (registers + program counter)
- Determines type of interrupt:
    - **Polling**
    - **Vectored** interrupt system
- Each interrupt type has a dedicated handler code
