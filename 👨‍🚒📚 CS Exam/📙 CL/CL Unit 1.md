# 1.1 Introduction to Cyber Security

-> Practices, tools, and processes used to protect computer systems, networks, programs, and data from digital attack, unauthorized access and damage.
#### Key components of Cyber Security
1. **Confidentiality** - Sensitive Info accessible only to authorized 
	- Encryption, access control, authentication mechanism
1. **Integrity** - Protecting info from being altered or tempered
	- Digital Signature, Checksums
2. **Availability** - reliable access to info and resources
	- prevent DoS attacks, Maintain uptime, backup systems

>*DoS - Denial of Service*
##### Why Cyber Security Crucial
1. National Security 
2. Financial Impact
3. Data Protection
4. Reputation Damage
5. Regulatory Compliance*

#### Types of Cyber Security
1. Network Security - firewall, *IDS*, Network monitoring
2. Application and Device Security - updating software, strong encryption, adhere to secure coding practices
3. Information Security
4. Operational Security - secure practice for day-to-day handling and sharing of data
5. Cloud Security(application, data, service on *CCE*) - encryption, secure access control, regular monitoring
6. Disaster Recovery and Business Security Planning*

>*CCE- cloud computing environment*
>*IDS- intrusion detection system*

##### Cyber Threats
1. **Malware** - Malicious software designed to disrupt, damage or gain unauthorized access to system
	- **Virus** - Self-replicating programs that attach itself to files or programs and infect a system and require user action to spread ( corrupt files, modify data, crash system)
	- **Worms** - Self-replicating and Standalone program that spreads automatically over networks (slow down network , deliver payloads)
	- **Trojans** - disguised as legitimate software, tricking user to install
	- **Ransomwares** - Encrypts victim's file and demands a ransom for release
2. **Phishing**
3. **SQL injection**
4. **DoS attacks**
5. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (MitM)**
6. **Insider Threats**

# 1.3 Intervention Strategies in Cyber Security

-> Methods and Techniques designed to prevent, mitigate and respond to cyber threats.

#### Key Approaches to Cybersecurity Intervention
1. Redundancy
	- Data Redundancy
	- Network Redundancy
	- System Redundancy
2. Diversity
	- Software Diversity
	- Hardware Diversity
	- Approach Diversity
	- Organizational Diversity
3. Autarchy
	- In-House Development and Management - develop and manage their own security systems and infrastructure ( rather than relying on third party vendors)
		- creating proprietary software, maintaining internal data centers, hiring dedicated cybersecurity teams
	
	- Minimizing Vendor Lock-in - reduce dependence on a single vendor or service provider (which can limit flexibility and security)
		- switch providers or develop in-house solutions
	
	- Data Sovereignty - Keep Sensitive data withing organization control (rather then relying on cloud service providers or external data storage solutions)

	- Control Over Critical Infrastructure - control over critical infrastructure such as finance, healthcare, and government
		- building and maintaining private networks, data centers, or secure communication channels

##### Benefits of Intervention
1. Redundancy - High availability, Business continuity, Risk Mitigation
2. Diversity - Increased Security, Resilience, Reduce Vulnerability
3. Autarchy - Increased Security Control, Reduced Third-Party Risk, Customization
##### Challenges to Interventions
1. Redundancy - Expensive, Complexity
2. Diversity - Management Overhead, Integration Complexity
3. Autarchy - Costly, Maintenance & Expertise


#### Layered Approach ( Defence in Depth)

- Intervention strategies often combined as part of a layered security approach

1. **Firewalls and IDS** - blocking unauthorized access and Monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity.
2. **Encryption** 
3. **Access Control** - RBAC and MFA
4. **Incident Response Plans** * - respond quickly and effectively so minimizing damage and recovery time

> *RBAC - Role-based access Control*
> *MFA - Multi-factor authentication*

##### Benefits of Layered Approach
- Multiple Barriers for attackers - each layer a new challenge for attacker
- Comprehensive Protection : cover various aspects, from external attacks to limiting insider threats
- Minimized Risk of Full compromise
