# Jupyter Notebook Browser 

Use terminal to Install

**Install :**
```
!pip install notebook
```
- In **Jupyter Notebooks**, the `!` is used to run **shell commands** (system commands) directly from the notebook environment.

**Run Jupyter notebook :**
```
jupyter notebook
```
- Opens a **web app** in your browser.
- Works and saves data **on your local computer**.


**Open Jupyter in Specific Folder (Outside Default Root) :**
```
jupyter notebook --notebook-dir="D:/gkmee/Downloads/BTP Project"
```

**Open Path Inside Root Folder (via UI) :**
```
File -> Open from Path -> Enter Path.
```
- Only works for paths **inside** the root directory.
- Windows supports `/` or `\\` for paths.

**Uninstall Jupyter Notebook:**
```sh
pip uninstall notebook
```

**To clean leftover dependencies (optional but recommended):**
```sh
pip uninstall jupyter-core jupyter-client ipykernel ipython
```
- These are **core dependencies** of both Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab.  
- Uninstalling them breaks Jupyter kernel execution and interactivity.  
- Only use when fully uninstalling Jupyter ecosystem.
