# How will I get Owner Recognition?

With the MIT License, you get recognition because **users are legally required to include your copyright notice** in any copy, modified version, or redistributed version of your software.

**How MIT License Ensures Recognition?**

1. **Mandatory Attribution**
    
    - Anyone who uses, modifies, or distributes your software **must keep your original copyright notice**.
    - Example: If a company uses your open-source code in their project, they must mention you in their documentation, about page, or license file.
2. **Public Visibility on GitHub & Open-Source Platforms**
    
    - When developers fork or star your repository, your project gets noticed.
    - Contributors usually credit the original author in README files, blog posts, or release notes.
3. **Industry & Community Recognition**
    
    - If your software is useful, companies or projects using it may mention it in **conferences, articles, or social media**.
    - Developers contributing back will acknowledge your work.
4. **Indirect Career Benefits**
    
    - Having an open-source project with an MIT License can make your portfolio stronger.
    - Recruiters, companies, or startups may recognize your contributions and offer collaboration or job opportunities.

**Example of Recognition in a Real-World Scenario**

- **React.js** (by Facebook) and **TensorFlow** (by Google) use permissive licenses like MIT/Apache.
- Even though companies use them freely, they still credit the original creators in documentation and acknowledgments.

So, while MIT License doesnâ€™t force people to publicly "thank" you, **legal attribution + visibility + community adoption** ensure you get recognition.
