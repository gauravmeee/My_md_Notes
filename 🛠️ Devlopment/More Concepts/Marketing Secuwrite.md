##### Finally found a privacy-first journaling app that keeps my thoughts secure
```
I was searching for a journaling app that works on the go, in any browser, and can back up entries. I tried many apps, but most smaller ones are hard to reach or lack proper privacy features. A friend suggested this one, and I was pleasantly surprised.

Key features I liked:
- End-to-end encryption
- Lock feature to prevent access even if someone has your device
- Offline access so your thoughts never leave your device

It’s perfect for people who want to journal freely without worrying about privacy. I’d love to hear **your feedback** and hope it can help anyone looking for a private journaling solution.

**How to share:**
1. **Post in one subreddit first**, wait 1–2 days for engagement.
2. **Engage with comments**, reply to questions, upvote helpful replies.
3. After 1–2 days, post in the next subreddit.
4. **Do not post in all at once**—Reddit may shadowban or downrank your posts.
    

**Tips for new accounts:**

- Comment on posts first to get some karma.
- Avoid posting links in your very first posts. Start by **sharing thoughts or experiences**.
- Once you have some activity, start sharing your app in a natural way.
