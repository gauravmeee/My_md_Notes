For true end-to-end encryption with multi-device support and password recovery, you'll need to restructure your key management. Here are the key approaches:

## Core Architecture Changes

**1. Client-Side Key Derivation**

- Never store the master encryption key on your server
- Derive keys from user passwords using PBKDF2, Argon2, or scrypt
- Generate a unique salt per user (store this on server - it's safe)

**2. Key Hierarchy Structure**

```
User Password → Master Key → Data Encryption Keys
```

## Multi-Device Solutions

**Option A: Password-Based Sync**

- Users enter their password on each device
- Each device derives the same master key
- Simple but requires password entry per device

**Option B: Device Key Exchange**

- First device generates and encrypts a shared vault key
- New devices get authorized through QR codes or similar
- Encrypted vault key gets shared between trusted devices
- More user-friendly but requires device-to-device authentication

## Password Recovery Methods

**1. Recovery Key Approach**

- Generate a long, random recovery phrase (12-24 words)
- User must securely store this offline
- Recovery key can regenerate master encryption key
- Most secure but relies on user responsibility

**2. Encrypted Key Escrow**

- Encrypt master key with recovery questions/answers
- Store encrypted version on server
- Server never sees plaintext recovery answers
- Less secure but more user-friendly

**3. Social Recovery**

- Split recovery key among trusted contacts using Shamir's Secret Sharing
- Require M-of-N contacts to recover access
- Most complex but very secure

## Recommended Implementation

1. **Use PBKDF2/Argon2** to derive master key from password
2. **Store only encrypted data** and salts on server
3. **Implement recovery keys** as primary recovery method
4. **Add device authorization** for seamless multi-device experience
5. **Consider backup codes** as secondary recovery

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or help design the specific implementation details?

You need a **hybrid approach** that balances security with practical recovery. Here's a robust solution:

## Dual-Key Architecture

**Primary Path: User-Controlled**

- User password → Master Key → Data Encryption
- Fully client-side, never touches server

**Recovery Path: Server-Assisted**

- Backup key encrypted with recoverable method
- Server helps but can't decrypt alone

## Recovery Solutions That Don't Rely on User Responsibility

**1. Security Questions + Device Fingerprinting**

```
Recovery Key = PBKDF2(SecurityAnswers + DeviceFingerprint + UserEmail)
```

- Multiple security questions (5-7 questions)
- Combine with device characteristics
- Server stores encrypted backup key using this derived key
- User answers questions + verifies email/SMS → recovery

**2. Biometric + Knowledge Factors**

- Store encrypted backup key using biometric hash + PIN/pattern
- Biometrics provide uniqueness, PIN provides something user knows
- Works across devices with same biometric enrollment

**3. Graduated Recovery System**

```
Level 1: Password
Level 2: Password + 2FA device
Level 3: Security questions + email + SMS
Level 4: Account recovery (manual verification)
```

## Recommended Implementation

**Setup Phase:**

1. User creates password → generates Master Key A
2. System generates Master Key B (backup)
3. Encrypt data with both keys (OR operation)
4. Encrypt Master Key B with recovery factors
5. Store encrypted Master Key B on server

**Normal Usage:**

- User password → Master Key A → decrypt data

**Recovery Usage:**

- Security questions + 2FA → Master Key B → decrypt data
- Once recovered, user sets new password → new Master Key A

**Multi-Device:**

- Each device gets Master Key A through password
- Recovery available on any device through server-assisted flow

## Security Benefits

- Server never sees plaintext master keys
- Even if recovery data is compromised, still needs multiple factors
- User doesn't need to remember/store anything beyond password
- Graceful degradation if user forgets password

**Recovery factors you could use:**

- Email verification
- SMS verification
- Security questions (answers hashed)
- Previous device verification
- Account creation details
- Usage patterns/behavioral biometrics

Let me break down exactly how the Dual-Key Architecture works:

## Key Generation & Setup

**1. User Registration:**

```
User creates password: "mypassword123"

Client generates:
- Master Key A = PBKDF2("mypassword123" + user_salt)
- Master Key B = Random 256-bit key (backup key)
- Recovery Key = PBKDF2(security_answers + email + device_info)

Client encrypts:
- User Data = AES_encrypt(data, Master Key A)
- Encrypted Backup = AES_encrypt(Master Key B, Recovery Key)

Server stores:
- Encrypted user data
- Encrypted Backup (can't decrypt without recovery factors)
- User salt, recovery salt
- Hashed security question answers
```

## Normal Usage (Primary Path)

**Login Process:**

```
1. User enters password on any device
2. Client: Master Key A = PBKDF2(password + salt from server)
3. Client: Decrypted Data = AES_decrypt(encrypted_data, Master Key A)
4. User sees their data
```

_Server never sees Master Key A or plaintext data_

## Recovery Process (Backup Path)

**When user forgets password:**

```
1. User clicks "Forgot Password"
2. User answers security questions + email verification
3. Client: Recovery Key = PBKDF2(answers + email + device_info)
4. Client: Master Key B = AES_decrypt(encrypted_backup, Recovery Key)
5. Client: Decrypted Data = AES_decrypt(encrypted_data, Master Key B)
6. User can now set new password → new Master Key A
```

## Data Encryption Strategy

**Option 1: Dual Encryption**

```
Final Encrypted Data = AES_encrypt(AES_encrypt(data, Master Key A), Master Key B)
```

- Requires BOTH keys to decrypt
- More secure but recovery overwrites primary path

**Option 2: Alternative Encryption (Recommended)**

```
Store two copies:
- Primary: AES_encrypt(data, Master Key A)
- Backup: AES_encrypt(data, Master Key B)
```

- Either key can decrypt
- Slightly more storage but cleaner recovery

## Multi-Device Support

**New Device Setup:**

```
Primary Path: User enters password → derives Master Key A → access data
Recovery Path: User uses recovery flow → gets Master Key B → access data
```

## Security Properties

**What Server Knows:**

- Encrypted data (useless without keys)
- Encrypted backup key (useless without recovery factors)
- Salts (not sensitive)
- Hashed security answers (can't reverse)

**What Server Cannot Do:**

- Decrypt user data (no master keys)
- Recover user account alone (needs user's recovery factors)
- Access data if user loses both password AND recovery factors

**Attack Scenarios:**

- **Server breach:** Encrypted data is safe, recovery requires user factors
- **Password compromise:** Recovery path still requires additional factors
- **Recovery factor compromise:** Still needs server's encrypted backup

The key insight is that **two independent paths** lead to the same data, but neither path can be completed by the server alone - user participation is always required.

## How Dual-Key Works (Simple Explanation)

Think of it like having **two different keys** to the same house:

### Setup

- **Key 1 (Main Key)**: Made from your password
- **Key 2 (Backup Key)**: Random key, but locked in a special box
- Your data is encrypted so either key can unlock it

### Normal Use

- You type your password
- System makes Key 1 from your password
- Key 1 unlocks your data
- Server never sees your password or Key 1

### When You Forget Password

- You answer security questions + verify email
- System uses your answers to open the special box
- Gets Key 2 from the box
- Key 2 unlocks your data
- You can then set a new password (new Key 1)

### Why It's Secure

- Server stores your encrypted data but can't read it
- Server has the locked box (Key 2) but can't open it without your security answers
- Even if someone hacks the server, they need either:
    - Your password (to make Key 1), OR
    - Your security answers + email access (to get Key 2)

### Multi-Device

- Any device: Enter password → get your data
- Lost password: Use security questions on any device → recover access

**Bottom line:** You have two ways to access your data, but the server can't access it through either way without you providing something only you know.

Great questions! Let me clarify:

## Key 2 Storage & Purpose

**Where is Key 2 stored?**

- Key 2 is stored on the **server**, but encrypted
- It's locked with your security answers + email verification
- NOT stored on your device

**Key 2's purpose:**

- Yes, decrypt data when password is forgotten
- Yes, allows setting new password
- It's your "emergency access" to your own data

## What if user forgets security questions?

**This is the biggest weakness.** You have a few options:

**Option 1: Multiple Recovery Methods**

- Security questions + email verification + SMS
- If you forget questions, still have email + SMS
- Need at least 2 out of 3 methods

**Option 2: Graceful Account Recovery**

- Manual verification process (support team)
- Upload ID, answer personal questions
- More friction but prevents total lockout

**Option 3: Accept the Risk**

- If user loses password AND security answers = data lost forever
- Most secure but harsh for users

## After Password Reset

**What happens to keys?**

1. User recovers access with Key 2
2. User sets new password
3. **New Key 1** is generated from new password
4. **Key 2 stays the same** (no need to change)
5. Data gets re-encrypted with new Key 1
6. Old Key 1 becomes useless

**Why keep same Key 2?**

- Security questions haven't changed
- Avoids re-encrypting the backup copy
- Simpler process

**Alternative approach:**

- Generate both new Key 1 and new Key 2
- Ask user to set new security questions
- More secure but more work for user

**Recommendation:** Keep same Key 2, only generate new Key 1. Change Key 2 only if user wants to update security questions.
