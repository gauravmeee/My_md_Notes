## echo ?
The echo command in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS, as well as in the Windows Command Prompt and PowerShell, is used to display a line of text or a string.

### Syntax
```sh
echo [option(s)] [string(s)]
```
### Display a simple message
```sh
echo "Hello, World!"
```
note:- like powershell `""` is not used in `cmd`

### Write output to a file (create file if not exist)

```sh
echo Hello, world! > myfile.txt
```

###  Display the value of a variable
```sh
name="Gaurav"
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

###  Print multiple lines
```sh
echo -e "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3"
```
### Common Options
- `-e`: Enable interpretation of backslash escapes (like `\n` for newline).
- `-n`: Do not output the trailing newline.
- `-E`: Disable interpretation of backslash escapes (default behavior).
