Here's the difference between the three variations of `onClick` in React:

### 1. **`onClick = {onDelete()}`**

- **What happens:**
    
    - `onDelete()` is immediately executed when the component renders.
    - The result of `onDelete()` (whatever it returns) is assigned to `onClick`.
- **When to use:**
    
    - Rarely, and only if `onDelete()` returns a function that should be called when the button is clicked.
- **Example:**
    
    ```jsx
    const onDelete = () => {
      console.log("Function executed");
    };
    
    <button onClick={onDelete()}>Delete</button>;
    ```
    
    - The function executes immediately when the component renders, not when the button is clicked.

### 2. **`onClick = {onDelete}`**

- **What happens:**
    
    - A reference to the `onDelete` function is passed to the `onClick` handler.
    - The function is called only when the button is clicked.
- **When to use:**
    
    - The recommended approach if no arguments need to be passed to the function.
- **Example:**
    
    ```jsx
    const onDelete = () => {
      console.log("Button clicked");
    };
    
    <button onClick={onDelete}>Delete</button>;
    ```
    
    - The `onDelete` function runs only when the button is clicked.

---

### 3. **`onClick = {() => onDelete()}`**

- **What happens:**
    
    - A new arrow function is created, and it executes `onDelete()` when the button is clicked.
- **When to use:**
    
    - Use this approach if you need to pass arguments to the `onDelete` function or if the function needs to be explicitly invoked.
- **Example with arguments:**
    
    ```jsx
    const onDelete = (id) => {
      console.log(`Deleting item with ID: ${id}`);
    };
    
    <button onClick={() => onDelete(1)}>Delete</button>;
    ```
    
    - The `onDelete` function is invoked with an argument when the button is clicked.

---

### **Key Differences:**

|Syntax|Executes Immediately?|When Called?|Use Case|
|---|---|---|---|
|`onClick={onDelete()}`|Yes|During render|Rare, if `onDelete()` returns a function.|
|`onClick={onDelete}`|No|On button click|Standard use case without arguments.|
|`onClick={() => onDelete()}`|No|On button click|When arguments or custom logic is needed.|

---

### **Preferred Approach:**

- Use **`onClick={onDelete}`** for simplicity when no arguments are required.
- Use **`onClick={() => onDelete(args)}`** when arguments or additional logic are necessary.
