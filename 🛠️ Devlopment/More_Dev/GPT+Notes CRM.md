# Salesforce API


Here are the key points from the provided text:

1. **REST API Overview**:
   - REST API is a web interface to access Salesforce data without the Salesforce UI.
   - Allows performing operations and integrating Salesforce into applications.

2. **Functionality**:
   - REST API tools enable creating, manipulating, and searching data in Salesforce via HTTP requests.
   - Access and operate on different pieces of information (resources) like records, query results, and metadata.

3. **Architecture**:
   - Uses RESTful architecture for a straightforward and consistent interface.
   - Easier to use than SOAP API, requiring less tooling while offering substantial functionality.

4. **Other Salesforce APIs**:
   - Other APIs like Bulk 2.0 API, Metadata API, and Connect REST API provide additional functionality for specific tasks.


Here are the key points from the provided text on REST resources and requests in the Salesforce API:

### REST Resources and Requests
1. **Resources**:
   - REST API is based on resources, which are data pieces in Salesforce (e.g., records, collections, query results, metadata).
   - Each resource has a unique URI accessed via HTTP requests.

2. **Operations**:
   - You can perform various operations, including:
     - Determining available API versions
     - Accessing limits for your Salesforce org
     - Retrieving object metadata
     - Creating, reading, updating, and deleting records
     - Querying and searching for data

3. **HTTP Requests**:
   - HTTP requests consist of:
     - URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
     - HTTP method
     - Headers
     - Request body (not required for GET requests)

4. **URIs**:
   - The structure of a URI:
     ```
     https://MyDomainName.my.salesforce.com/services/data/vXX.X/resource/
     ```
   - Replace `MyDomainName` with your Salesforce org's subdomain, `XX.X` with the API version, and `resource` with the specific resource path.
   - Note case-sensitivity for certain URI parts, like IDs.

5. **HTTP Methods**:
   - Standard HTTP methods supported include HEAD, GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE.
   - Each method has a specific purpose based on the resource being accessed.

6. **Headers**:
   - Headers pass parameters and customize HTTP requests. Common headers include:
     - `HTTP Accept`: Specifies response format (application/json or application/xml).
     - `HTTP Content-type`: Specifies request body format (application/json or application/xml).
     - `HTTP Authorization`: Contains OAuth 2.0 access token for authorization (Bearer type).
     - Compression and conditional request headers may also be used.

7. **Request Bodies**:
   - Request bodies can provide additional information (e.g., field values for records) and are formatted in JSON or XML.
   - GET requests do not require a request body.

8. **Additional Information**:
   - Check resources for more details on usage and specific operations.
   - Documentation provides guides for sending REST requests with cURL and setting up development environments.
