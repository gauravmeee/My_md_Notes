# [Difference Between REST API vs Web API vs SOAP API Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mqN7ZhDsUA&ab_channel=LearnwithWhiteboard)

### **What is Web API?**

**Definition**:
- A broader term that includes all APIs that can be accessed over the internet.
- Includes **REST API**, **SOAP**, **XML-RPC**, and others.

**Key Features**:
- Can use different protocols such as **HTTP**, **HTTPS**, and **TCP/IP**.
- Does not follow a specific architecture.
- Provides a **flexible interface** for communication between clients and servers.
- Can support functionalities like **CRUD operations**, **authentication**, **authorization**, and more.

**When to Use Web API**:
- Best for **complex applications** that require integration with various systems.
- Suitable for applications requiring **authentication**, **authorization**, and **security**.
- More flexible than REST API for varying requirements.

### **What is REST API?**

**Definition**:
- REST stands for **Representational State Transfer**.
- A **web-based API** that follows the REST architectural style.

**Key Features**:
- Based on **HTTP** (standard protocol on the internet).
- Uses **HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources.
- Resources are identified by unique **URLs**.
- Data is returned in **JSON** or **XML** format.
- Follows a **stateless client-server model** (server doesn't store any client information between requests).

**When to Use REST API**:
- Ideal for **stateless**, **scalable**, and easy-to-maintain web services.
- Suitable for applications requiring **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Useful for **real-time communications**, such as chat apps and streaming services.

### **What is SOAP API?**

**Definition**:
- SOAP stands for **Simple Object Access Protocol**.
- A messaging protocol for exchanging structured data between applications.

**Key Features**:
- Uses **XML** for data exchange.
- Supports various data types like **text**, **numbers**, **dates**, and **binary data**.
- Supports multiple transport protocols (HTTP, SMTP, FTP).
- Follows specific rules and protocols defined in **WSDL** (Web Services Description Language).
- Has **advanced security features**, including **digital signatures** and **encryption**.

**When to Use SOAP API**:
- Ideal for applications requiring **highly secure** and **reliable** data exchange.
- Suited for **enterprise-level applications** needing complex data structures.
- Recommended for applications requiring advanced security features like **digital signatures** and **encryption**.


### Difference Between REST API, Web API, and SOAP API

|**Aspect**|**REST API**|**Web API**|**SOAP API**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Architecture Style**|Follows **REST** architectural style|No specific architecture or structure|Follows a set of **rules and protocols**|
|**Protocols Used**|Primarily **HTTP**|Can use any protocol (HTTP, TCP/IP, etc.)|Requires **SOAP-specific protocols** (WSDL, UDDI)|
|**Data Format**|**JSON** or **XML**|Can use various formats (JSON, XML, CSV, etc.)|**XML** only|
|**Statefulness**|**Stateless** (no server-side state)|Can be **stateful** or **stateless**|**Stateless** (but allows more complexity)|
|**Usage**|Ideal for **simple applications**, **CRUD** operations, **real-time communication**|Suitable for **complex applications** requiring integration with various systems and technologies|Suitable for **enterprise-level applications** with complex data and requiring **security**|
|**Security**|Basic security mechanisms (HTTPS)|Depends on implementation; customizable|Advanced security features (encryption, digital signatures)|
|**Flexibility**|Less flexible, as it follows a specific style|Highly flexible; can be designed for various needs|Less flexible due to strict protocols|
|**Complexity**|**Low to Medium**|**Medium to High**|**High** due to strict rules and protocols|
|**Ideal Use Case**|**Web, mobile, and desktop apps** needing CRUD and real-time features|Complex systems requiring integration with multiple technologies|**Enterprise applications** needing high security and reliability|
