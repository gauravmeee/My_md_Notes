## How to Behave and Speak.
- ==Speak with clarity==, 
- ==avoid aggression==, 
- ==keep a logical flow==, 
- ==show teamwork==.

**What SJVN Panel Looks For**  
- Structured thinking.  
- Understanding of energy-sector context.  
- Balanced view, not one-sided.  
- Team behaviour.  
- Clarity with minimal words.

**How to Speak in GD**  
- Enter early with a clear opening definition.  
- Never interrupt strongly; cut-in only when the pause is natural.  
- Build on others’ points rather than contradicting directly.  
- Use simple structure: point → logic → short example.  
- Stay neutral, avoid emotional or extreme claims.  
- Aim to summarise if the group becomes chaotic.

## Know SJVN

**Know**
- Know ==SJVN’s business==, 
- Know ==SJVN's recent projects==, 
- Know SJVN's ==hydro & renewable sector==, 
- Know PSU ==role in energy security==.
- More: SJVN projects, capacity, recent MoUs, renewable plans, role in national grid and energy transition.

**GD structured points:** 
1. ==Definition:== Start with a single-line definition.  
2. ==2 Core Arguments==: Give Two clear arguments supported by logic or recent context.  
3. ==1 Counter View:== Add One balanced counter-view.  
4. ==Conclusion:== Close with a precise conclusion and actionable insight.  

**Practical GD Strategy**  
- If topic is factual -> lead with ==definition==.  
- If topic is abstract -> give 2 interpretations and choose one.  
- Use ==data-driven statements== even approximate, to appear credible.  
- Avoid name-dropping technologies without context.  
- Keep points short, factual, and calm.

**Focus areas:** 
- Energy policy, national energy mix. 
- Hydro importance: storage, grid stability, peaking power.  
- sustainability and Renewables: solar/wind integration, intermittency, storage need. 
- Digitalisation in PSUs: automation, ERP, data governance, cybersecurity.  
- Public infrastructure: national grid, transmission reliability.  
- AI in governance, national infrastructure : transparency, efficiency, risk mitigation.


### Sample Q/A

##### **1. Topic: Renewable vs Non-Renewable Energy**  

-> **Short Answer:** Renewable sources ==reduce fuel risk and emissions==, but they ==create intermittency and grid-stability challenges==. Non-renewables provide baseload reliability but lock us into long-term environmental and import costs. The balanced path is diversified capacity with hydro and storage stabilising renewables.

- **Grid-stability:** ==Grid-stability challenges== are the ==technical problems== that occur when ==electricity supply and demand are not balanced== at every moment.
	1. **Intermittency:** Solar stops at night, wind fluctuates. Sudden drop or spike creates imbalance.
	2. **Frequency deviation:** Grid must stay near 50 Hz. Unstable generation causes frequency swings that can trip lines.
	3. **Voltage fluctuations:** Irregular power inflow changes reactive power balance and affects voltage.
	4. **Ramp rates:** Renewables can change output too fast; grid assets cannot always adjust quickly.
	5. **Load balancing:** Matching variable generation with varying demand becomes difficult without storage or hydro support.

-> **Long Answer:**
##### **2. Topic: Is Digitalisation making PSUs more efficient?**

-> **Short Answer:** Digitalisation ==improves transparency, faster workflows, data integrity, and predictive maintenance==. The ==constraint is legacy systems and skill gaps==. Efficiency rises only when technology is supported by training, cybersecurity and disciplined execution. The PSU ecosystem benefits most from phased digital adoption.

- **Legacy systems** : ==Old software, outdated hardware, old databases, and non-integrated systems== still used in PSUs. They are stable but slow, insecure, hard to upgrade, and not compatible with modern digital tools.

- **Skill gaps** :Employees may ==not have updated knowledge== of cloud, cybersecurity, data analytics, modern ERP, or automation tools. This slows digital transformation because technology adoption needs trained manpower.

- **Phased digital adoption** : Instead of replacing everything at once, ==PSUs upgrade step-by-step==:
	1. ==Modernise== core infrastructure.
	2. ==Introduce ERP==, cybersecurity layers, and automation.
	3. ==Train employees==.
	4. ==Integrate advanced tools== like analytics and AI.

-> **Long Answer:**
##### **3. Topic: Should India prioritise Hydro over Solar?**  
-> **Short Answer:** Hydro provides ==long life, grid stability, and storage==, ==making it critical for peak load==. Solar is faster and cheaper to deploy. India should not prioritise one over the other; instead, ==use hydro as the stabilising backbone and solar as the scalable front-end== to meet growing demand.

##### **4. Topic: Is AI a threat or an opportunity for India?**  

-> **Short Answer:** AI ==automates routine tasks== and ==improves decision quality==, giving India productivity gains. ==The threat emerges when regulation, data governance and skill development lag==. With strong policy and talent investment, AI becomes an economic multiplier instead of a job threat.

- **Data governance** is the set of rules, processes, and controls that ensure an organisation’s data is **accurate, secure, consistent, and properly used**.
	1. **Data quality:** Ensuring data is correct and reliable.
	2. **Data security:** Protecting data from leaks or unauthorised access.
	3. **Access control:** Only the right people can view or modify data.
	4. **Data ownership:** Clear responsibility for each dataset.
	5. **Compliance:** Following laws and internal policies.
	6. **Standardisation:** Common formats and definitions across departments.

##### **5. Topic: Should Public Sector Enterprises compete like private companies?**  

-> **Short Answer:** ==PSUs must adopt== ==efficiency, innovation and accountability== similar to private firms, ==but their mandate includes== ==national service, stability and infrastructure creation.== A hybrid model works best: operational competitiveness with strategic responsibility aligned to national goals.
