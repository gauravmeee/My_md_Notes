# Arrays


**Can't declare array without size or initializer list**
```cpp
`int arr[]; // ‚ùå This will cause a compilation error.` 
```
compiler doesn't know the size of the array, You must either specify the size of the array explicitly or provide an initializer list.

---
Default Value of Elements when initialize size 

```cpp
int arr[5]; // elments value are undefined
int arr[5]={}; // all element initialisez `0`
int arr[5]={1}; // first elmenent initialize `1`, rest `0`
int arr[5]={1, 2}; // arr[0] = 1, arr[1] = 2, and the rest are 0.
```

**Initializing Size of array should be constant**
- `int arr[a];` ‚ùå : if `int a=5` ->  variable
- `int arr[b];` ‚úÖ : if `const int b=5` -> constant  

Note: In C++, the code `int arr[n];` ==is valid in some compilers== (like`gcc`) due to Variable Length Array (VLA) support, but it is not part of the C++ standard, which requires array sizes to be known at compile time. A better and standard-compliant approach is to use `std::vector` for dynamic arrays, as it provides safer memory management and flexibility when the array size is determined at runtime.

<hr>

**Assignment of array should include `[]`**
- `int arr = { 1, 2, 3};` invalid in C++ ‚ùå : without `[]` compiler will think `arr` as Scaler Object
- `int arr[] = { 1, 2, 3};` ‚úÖ
---
**Assigning all elements to -1 (without iteration)**
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
int n = 5; // Example size 
int arr[n]; // in some compiler it is valid to use variable size but not safe
std::fill(arr, arr + n, -1); üÜï
```

<hr>

**Method to find Size of array**
- `int n = arr.size();` not valid ‚ùå `size()` is part of C++ Standard Library such as std::vector, std::array
- `int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);` ‚úÖ
<hr>

**Array should contain initialization object should be inside `{}` list initializer:**
- `int arr[] = [3, 1, 2]` ‚ùå
- `int arr[] = {3, 1, 2}` ‚úÖ

<hr>

**String can be Stored in Array :**
- `char str1[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};` 
'\0' is the null terminator
- `char str2[] = "Hello";`  str2=str1 -> are string
- `sizeof(str1)/sizeof(str1[0])` =  `sizeof(str2)/sizeof(str2[0])` = **6**
---
**Sort an array**
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
int arr[] = {5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6}; 
int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]); 
sort(arr, arr + n); ‚≠ê
```
---
**In build Swap Func**.
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
    std::swap(arr[1], arr[3]);
```
---
**Passed array as Pointer and Reference in Function ? ** ‚≠ê‚≠ê

C++ requires the size of the array to be known at compile time when using array references.

**Pass as reference** If know the size at compile time
```cpp
void modifyArray(int (&arr)[5]){...}
```


In C++, if you don't know the size of the array at compile time, you cannot pass the array as a reference with a fixed size directly. but you can use Pointer.
**Pass as pointer** if size not known at compile time (for similar functionality)
```cpp
void modifyArray(int* arr, int size){...}
// We can't find size of pointer so need to pass run-time/compile-time size as additional parameter
```
