### g++ ( GNU C++ compiler )
`GNU` is a broader project aimed at creating a free Unix-like operating system with various tools and utilities. `G++` is a `C++` compiler within the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), used to compile C++ programs.

*Note:* installing `MinGW` will automatically install `g++`

```sh
# check g++ version
g++ --version

# compile the source "demo.cpp" to the compiled executable "demo"
g++ demo.cpp -o demo 

# compile the source "demo.cpp" to the compiled executable "a.exe"
g++ demo.cpp

# Run the program
g++ demo.exe
```
