# Opens the `my_project` folder in the current VS Code window. 
& If no window is open, it will create a new one.

```bash
code -r my_project
```

- **`code`**: Refers to the VS Code command-line tool.
- **`-r`**: Stands for "reuse window," which means it will open the specified project in the currently open VS Code window instead of creating a new one.
- **`project`**: Refers to the folder or project directory you want to open in VS Code.

If you face issues running `code` from the terminal, you may need to install the command-line tool:

1. Open VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
3. Type and select **"Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"**.
