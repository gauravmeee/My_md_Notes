# Procedural and Non Procedural Language

## Procedural Language (DBMS)

* User specifies <mark>_what data_ is required **and** _how to get it_<mark> (sequence of steps)
* Query execution path is defined by user
* Define Steps, More control, <mark>less abstraction</mark>
*

**Examples:**

1. Relational Algebra
2. Tuple Relational Calculus (considered weakly procedural in exams)

**eg:- Relational Algebra** (RA)

```sql
π name (σ marks > 80 (STUDENT))
```

* First **<mark>select** tuples</mark>
* Then <mark>**project** attributes</mark>

**eg:- Tuple Relational Calculus** (TRC)

```sql
{ t.name | STUDENT(t) ∧ t.marks > 80 }
```

* Specify desired attribute in result
* Give condition on tuples (no explicit operation order)

**1. Relational Algebra Operations ⭐**

**Primitive (Basic) Operations:**

* Selection (σ)
* Projection (π)
* Cartesian Product (×)
* Union (∪)
* Set Difference (−)
* Rename (ρ)

**Derived Operations:**

* Intersection (∩)
* Join (⨝)
* Division (÷)

**Unary Operations**

| Operation  | Symbol | Purpose                          | Example                |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Selection  | σ      | Select rows satisfying condition | `σ_Age>20(Student)`    |
| Projection | π      | Select specific columns          | `π_Name, Age(Student)` |
| Rename     | ρ      | Rename relation or attributes    | `ρ_Stud(Student)`      |

**Binary Operations**

| Operation         | Symbol | Purpose                                  | Example                         |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Union             | ∪      | Tuples in either relation                | `Student ∪ Alumni`              |
| Set Difference    | -      | Tuples in first, not in second           | `Student - Alumni`              |
| Intersection      | ∩      | Tuples common to both                    | `Student ∩ Scholarship`         |
| Cartesian Product | ×      | All combinations of tuples               | `Student × Course`              |
| Join              | ⨝      | Combine tuples based on condition        | `Student ⨝_ID=Enroll.ID Enroll` |
| Division          | ÷      | Tuples related to all in second relation | `StudentID ÷ CourseID`          |

* **Unary:** operate on one relation
* **Binary:** operate on two relations
* **Rename (ρ)** helps in queries and avoiding conflicts.

**Examples** :

1. **Find all students older than 20** `σ_Age>20 (Student)`
2. **Find all students enrolled in a 4-credit course** `σ_Credit=4 (Student ⨝ Student.CourseID = Course.ID Course)`
3. **Find all students with marks > 80** `σ_Marks>80 (Student)`
4. **Find names of students in “DBMS” course** `π_Name (σ_CourseName='DBMS' (Student ⨝ Student.CourseID = Course.ID Course))`
5. **Find students who have taken all courses offered** `π_StudentID (Enroll) ÷ π_CourseID (Course)`

**2. Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC)**

| Feature             | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Definition          | Non-procedural query language using **tuples as variables**  |
| Tuple Variable      | Represents a tuple from a relation                           |
| Syntax              | `{t` \| `P(t)}`                                              |
| Predicate           | Condition on tuple `t` (comparisons, logical operators)      |
| Operators           | AND (`∧`), OR (`∨`), NOT (`¬`), `=`, `≠`, `<`, `>`, `≤`, `≥` |
| Quantifiers         | <mark>`∃` (exists)</mark>, <mark>`∀` (for all)<mark>                          |
| Characteristics     | Non-procedural; specifies **what** to retrieve, not **how**  |
| Difference from SQL | TRC is theoretical; SQL is practical                         |
| **Examples** :      |                                                              |

1. **Find all students older than 20**\
   `{ t | Student(t) ∧ t.Age > 20 }`
2. **Find all students enrolled in a 4-credit course**\
   `{ t | ∃c (Course(c) ∧ t.CourseID = c.ID ∧ c.Credit = 4) }`
3. **Find all students with marks > 80**\
   `{ t | Student(t) ∧ t.Marks > 80 }`
4. **Find names of students in “DBMS” course**\
   `{ t.Name | ∃c (Course(c) ∧ t.CourseID = c.ID ∧ c.CourseName = 'DBMS') }`
5. **Find students who have taken all courses offered**\
   `{ s | Student(s) ∧ ∀c (Course(c) → ∃e (Enroll(e) ∧ e.StudentID = s.ID ∧ e.CourseID = c.ID)) }`

## Non-Procedural Language (DBMS)

* User specifies <mark>_what data_ is required, not _how to retrieve_</mark>
* DBMS decides execution plan
* Define Result Only, High-level, declarative, high abstraction

**Examples:**

1. SQL
2. Query By Example
3. Domain Relational Calculus (QBE)

**eg:- SQL**

```sql
SELECT name FROM STUDENT WHERE marks > 80;
```

**eg:- Query By Example (QBE)**

* Put condition `>80` under marks
* Put `P.` under name

**eg:- Domain Relational Calculus (DRC)**

```sql
{ <n> | ∃ r (STUDENT(n, r) ∧ r > 80) }
```

* Specify required domain variable in result
* Use logical condition on domains (no execution order)

**3. SQL (Structured Query Language)**

| Feature             | Description                                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition          | Declarative query language for relational databases         |
| Nature              | Non-procedural (user specifies **what**, not **how**)       |
| Basis               | Based on Relational Algebra & Relational Calculus           |
| Core Clauses        | `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY` |
| Joins               | `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`                            |
| Quantification      | `EXISTS`, `NOT EXISTS`, `IN`, `ALL`, `ANY`                  |
| Characteristics     | Practical, optimized by DBMS                                |
| Difference from TRC | SQL is executable; TRC is mathematical                      |

**Examples** :

1. **Find all students older than 20** `SELECT * FROM Student WHERE Age > 20;`
2. **Find all students enrolled in a 4-credit course** `SELECT DISTINCT s.* FROM Student s, Course c WHERE s.CourseID = c.ID AND c.Credit = 4;`
3. **Find all students with marks > 80** `SELECT * FROM Student WHERE Marks > 80;`
4. **Find names of students in “DBMS” course** `SELECT s.Name FROM Student s, Course c WHERE s.CourseID = c.ID AND c.CourseName = 'DBMS';`

**2. QBE (Query By Example)**

| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Definition          | Visual, example-based query language           |
| Nature              | Non-procedural                                 |
| Basis               | Based on Domain Relational Calculus            |
| Query Style         | Conditions filled in table skeletons           |
| Output Indication   | `P.` (print)                                   |
| Usage               | Educational, conceptual (rare in real systems) |
| Difference from SQL | QBE is graphical; SQL is textual               |

**Examples** :

1. **Find all students older than 20**
   * Put `>20` under `Age`
   * Put `P.` under required attributes
2. **Find all students enrolled in a 4-credit course**
   * Course table: put `4` under `Credit`
   * Match `CourseID`
   * Put `P.` under Student attributes
3. **Find all students with marks > 80**
   * Put `>80` under `Marks`
   * Put `P.` under Student attributes
4. **Find names of students in “DBMS” course**

| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition          | Non-procedural query language using **domain variables** |
| Domain Variable     | Represents attribute values                              |
| Syntax              | `{ <x1, x2, …> \| P(x1, x2, …) }`                        |
| Predicate           | Conditions on domains using logic                        |
| Operators           | `∧`, `∨`, `¬`, `=`, `<`, `>`                             |
