# Casting in C++

Good question. Let’s break it clearly:

#### `int*`

* Declares a **pointer to int**.
*   Example:

    ```c
    int* p;  // p can point to an integer
    ```

#### `(int*)`

* This is a **type cast** operator.
* It tells the compiler: "Treat this value as a pointer to int".
*   Example with `malloc`:

    ```c
    int* p = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int));
    ```

Here, `malloc` returns a `void*` (generic pointer). In **C**:

* `void*` can be assigned to any pointer type **without cast**.
*   So this works fine too:

    ```c
    int* p = malloc(sizeof(int));
    ```

In **C++**:

* Implicit conversion from `void*` to other pointers is **not allowed**.
* That’s why we must use `(int*)malloc(...)` in C++.

#### Summary

* In **C**: Cast is optional → `int* p = malloc(sizeof(int));` (preferred).
* In **C++**: Cast is required → `int* p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));`
* Modern C++ avoids `malloc` and uses `new`/`delete`.

Do you want me to also show the **difference between malloc+free vs new+delete** in C++?
